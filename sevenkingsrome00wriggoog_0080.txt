cunr. xr. 71

no interval between the two actions. Livy represents the
coming down of the Sabines and the marching up of the
Romans as independeut and contemporaneous actions In sact
they are both in sense, though not in the sentence, main
actions. But complesset is in the pluperiect subjunctive aster
quum (which here, therefore, is a subjoiuing conjunction),
because it deuotes an action that not only took place some time
before the main action (in the‘ night), but was the cause oi the

main action. The Sabiues came down, because the Romans
had filled the plain. See XIX. 9.

4 ln aequum] A neuter adjective passed into a noun
(VII. 14); ‘to the level!

5 In adversum] ‘⁴ Marched up the hill to meet them.’'
Here too adversum has passed into a noun. Compare such ad·
verbial expressions as cx adverso, ‘over against: ‘opposite to ;’
de integro, ‘anew' (XVI. 3); ax imprecato, ‘unenpectedly ;’ in
preceps, ‘headlong3' primo, ‘firstly5' &a

6. Quarum ex injuria] “ Out of wrong done to whom the ,
war had arisen.” &aarum is in the genitive, as naming the
passive possessors os the wrong (III. 11). Caii injmrm may
either mean ‘wrong done by Caius ;’ caii being in the genitive,
remitmittere hilcwini& ‘lil’ngtis‘llss
possessor'of the wrongg. Occasgieonally both genitiies arepsound
attached to the same noun ; as, pro vermem Helvemrum injuriis
populi Romani, ‘sor old wrongs done by the Helvetii to the
Roman people,¹ where Helvetiomm is in the genitive as naming
the active, populi as naming the passive possessors os the
wrong.

7. Hine-hinc] “ Beseeching‚ on the one side their fathers,
on the other side their husbands, not to besprinkle themselves,
fathers-inlaw and sons-inlaw as they were, with unrigbteous
blood.” Observe that, where we use the words ‘one’—‘ other,¹
or ‘this ’-‘that,' the Romans use the same word z as, him-hinc, ,
‘from this place’-‘from this place! Quite rightly, because as
regards the speaker the place is no more ‘that' than ‘this'
So in the next sentence we have tum-tum, ‘at that time-‘at

that time:' one time as regards the speaker being no more
‘this’ than ‘that’

8. Turn-tum] “Not only the multitude, but also the
leaders.’¹ Notice this phrase for our ‘not only-but' Similarly
we had quum-tum (vl, 2).

9. Imperium] ·‘ Tm whole govemmeut they bring together
to Rome.” Imperium is in the accusative, as naming the object

(ἰιὶονεάες1 Romam, as naming the object to which motion is
rrect .
