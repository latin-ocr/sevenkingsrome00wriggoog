Ille nefastus erit, per quem tria verba silentur ι
fastus erit, per quem lege licebit agi z

Ovid has the former. The tria verba arethe three words Do,
Dico, Addam words constantly used by the praetor who pre-
sided over the courts: Do meaning, ‘1 grant judges, actions,
dcc. ς’ Dico, ‘I pronounce sentence3’ Addita, ‘I adjudge the
property in dispute’

10. Quia aliquando] “Because sometimes it was likely to
be expedient that no business should be transacted with the

peOPIes„

11. Assiduum] “ In constant attendance on Jupiter. '⁹ Assi-
duus (from ad and sedeo) means ‘sitting down. close to '—some
object: hence, ‘unremitting’ ‘perpetuali' In* English, the de·
rived meaning follows perhaps more plainly than in Latin; an
‘lassiduoyys' meakning an industribus person-ssone who sits down

12. Marti-Quirino] These nouns¹ are in the dative; not, as
kuic is, after affecit, but after the idea of creation contained in
aaiy‘ecit ‘In addition to this one, he created two other flamens3
one for Mars, the other for Quirinus.' Just so, Vestoe, in the next
line, and Marti, a little below, are in the dative aster legit. Τὴυε
there is no need to talk of verbs compounded with prepositions
y governing the dative, as they all fall under the general law: ‘Is
a verb denotes an action which can be conceived as operating on
two objects ι on one directly‚ so as to move or change it; on the
ι other indirectly, so as not to move or change it, but to influence
or affect it 3 the noun which names the former is in the accusa·
tive, the noun which names the latter is in the dative! Numa
chose virgins, who were moved by being taken out of the mass ;
therefore, uirgineis in the accusative. He chose them to attend
on Vesta, who, unmoved herself, was affected by having them
brought to heras attendants3 therefore, Vestae is in the dative
case.

CHAPTER XVII.

1. Ita duo] “Thus two kings in succession, one in one way,
one in another,—the former by war, the latter by peace,—
strengthened the state.” We have said (XIV. 6) that alter means
‘one or the other of two ς’ alius, ‘one or any other of more
than two' And this undoubtedly is the common usage. But as
both alens and alter come from the same root ali (from which
