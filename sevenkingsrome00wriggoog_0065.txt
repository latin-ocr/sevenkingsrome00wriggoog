56 noras.

in accordance with the general law, the genitive would he the
more usual construction.

14. E0.] ‘'shither,’ ‘to that place,’ ‘to that point.'

15. Quin agnosceret] “That he was not far from acknow·
ledging Remus.” Note down quin and the sentence it subjoins‚
whenever it occurs, and observe the corresponding English
zierfwifti? malli iiiiii-illici&
hardly bye’ prevented freni kz'llingqr himself ε’ vele me imetineo quin
involem in ellum ,· ‘I hardly restrain myselfftomstying at him!
Quin (from qui, theold ablative of the relative, and non) meant
originally, ‘in which manner not,’ ‘how not ;' hence, ‘so that
not' Thus the above sentences may be turned, ‘he could
hardly be hindered, so tkathe should notkill himself ς’ ‘I hardly
restrain myself, so thatI shall not fly at him'

16. A domo] Domus, meaning ‘home,’ follows the con-
struction of the names of towns. But when it means ‘house’
as here, it is used, like nouns generally, with prepositions (I. 3).

17. Postquam-vidit] Postquam is generally followed by
a verb in the perfect indicative. This shows two things with
respect to the action denoted by the verb. First, the moed
shows that the action is not meant to be represented as de·
pendent on the main action. Secondly, the tense shows that it is
not meant to be represented as taking place long before the main
, action. If it were, the pluperfect would be used: as, Honm'bol
anno testib, postquam domo perfiegerat, in Africam venit. Postquam,
therefore, must he regarded as an adjoining conjunction: and,
when followed by the perfect, as implying that the adjoined
action and the main action are to be considered as indepen-
dpnt of one another, and as happening close together in point
o time.

18. Ut geniti] “How they had been born, how educated,
and how discovered.'' Ut, originally cut, isthe adverb of manner
from qui (like vis from lis in Greek).

a. It means therefore, ‘in which manner‚' or ‘as3’ in which
sense it comes from the relative qui, and is an adj0ining con·
junctione as, ut opinor, ‘as Ι conceive’ (1).

b„ It also means, ‘in what manner,' or ‘how; ’ in which sense
it comes from the interrogative qui, andis a subjoining conjunc.
tion: as in the text, where it subjoins geniti essent to ostendit.
In this sense it is the proper Latin word for the English ‘how'
after such verbs as ‘show,’ ‘tell,’ dic. But care must be taken
that it is not ut for the English ‘that' after such verbs. ‘He
showed horo gaius had done this ;’ ostendit ut Caius hoc fecisset.
But, ‘He showed that Caius had done th1s;’ ostendit Caium hoc

secisse. ’
