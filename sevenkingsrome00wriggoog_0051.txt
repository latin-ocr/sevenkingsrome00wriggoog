8. Quum Troiani] Yon have here a eompound sentence. y
Passing through itin quest of the main subject-word, which must ’
be of course in the nominative case, you come first to Τ rojam‘.

But this is in a clause snbjoined to the main sentence by quum,
and must be subject-word to the snbjoined verb agerent. Then
corne Latinus and Aborigines, which are the words you want,
conjoined by the conjunction que. Where is the verb that
ll‘elraeflrlevlltahuslljealglrbeillgotwittellubtllztrellaotlvdhzlei.ls {ovptrbmplnSttpp
. coruumnt: and the main sentence, on which the secondary
clauses hang, is: ‘king Latium and the natives run together?

9. ‘Agerent.] Our law for the accusative is: ‘If an obJect is
spoken of as acted on directly by the subject, its nonnis in the
aceruative case! By ‘acted on directly,’ we mean, ‘moved' in
place, or ‘changed' in character or condition. This law leads
us to the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs.
If a verb denotes an action which passes on (transr't) from
the subject to some other object, so as to moveor change it,
it is said to be ‘transitive’ If averb denotes an action which
does not so pass on, it is said to be ‘intransitive' If 1 say,
Caius ambulat, ‘Caius walks,’ 1 say that Caius performs an
action which has to do only with himself, and does not pass
on to any other object: therefore ambulo, ‘walls' isan in-
transitive verb. lf l say, Caius agr't, ‘Caius drives,' I say that
Caius personnis an action which does pass on to another object,
so as to move it: and therefore ago, ‘drive’ isa transitive verb.
If Caius drives, he must drive something: as, ‘Caius drives
oxen’ In Latin, then, the word naming ‘oren’ will be in the
accusative case, because it names objects spoken of as acted on

' directly: as, Cuius beves φλ· or, as in the text, quum Trojani
predam agerent.

ro. Loca] Locus, whichis masculine in the singular, is both
masculine and neuter in the plural. So tonsurus, ‘ joke’ has in
the plural both joci and joca.

11. Vim] Vis, ‘force’ ‘strength’ is irregular. The geni-
tive, vis, and the dative, vi, are hardly ever found. Α. vim ,·
Ab. vi. Plur. N. and A. vires,· G. vinam ,0 D. and Ab. virilem
Vires, like our word ‘forces’ has the special sense, ‘military
forces,’ ‘troops'

12. Concurrunt] When writers wish to describe a past
action rividly, so as to make it seem actually present to t eir
readers, they use the present tense This use of the ‘Historical
Present,’ as it is called, does not necessarily alter the tense of
verbs snbjoined to it. The law for the sequence of tenses is:
If the main verb is in the present, future, or perfect definite
tense, the snbjoined verb is in the present (or perfect) subjunc-
tive: if the main verb is in the perfect indefinite, imperfect, or
