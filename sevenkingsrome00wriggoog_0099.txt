rated in oratio obliqua, as a present fact3 ‘we agree that the
people which conquers (or, shall conquer) shall rnle ς’ the Latin
would be, fadus icitur liis legibus, ut is, qui vz'ceri't, populus
imperitet: vi'cerit being no longer in the indicative moad, but
in the perfect subjunctive, which thus appears to have a future
as well as a perfect signification. Lastly, if the condition is
’ narrated as a past fact, as in the text; ‘it was agreed, that the

CHAPTER XXI.

l. Pleni vocibus] Plenus is used with two cases.

a. With the ablative; as, puer plenus cst ciba, ‘the boy is
filled with f00d3' cibo being in the ablative, as naming the
cause (IX. 7), or specified object (ΙΙ. uo). So vocilius, in the
text,

b. With the genitive ; as, puer plenus est cibi, ‘the boy is full
of food3' cibi being in the genitive, on the principle explained
VI. 5, and XV. 4. From such expressions as sati'rtas cibi,
‘satiety of food ς’ indigentia apum, ‘need of money ς’ the con-
struction is extended to adjectives and verbs denoting the
qualities of satiety, fulness, need, and the like3 as, plenus cibi,
adulescentem temeritatis implet (XXXIV. 6). dives auri, pauper
argenti, regia egena aqriae, parcns orbus liberorum, &a

2. Expertes] As the whole possesses the part, any word
denoting that one has a part in an object is followed by the
noun naming the object in the genitive; as, particeps consilii,
consors litis, &a Hence, too. any word denoting that one has
ceased to have a part in, or simply has not a part in, an object,
is followed by the genitive 3 as, expers periculi, exsors culpa, &a
Hence, too, the construction, reussurti, ‘accused of theft ;’ insons
probri, ‘innocent of guilt ;' and the like.

3. Agebatur] ‘⁴ Was at stakess’,

4. Minime gratum] Notice this mode of expressing the
very opposite of a quality. In Latin, the opposite is ordinarily
ejjffled by the pretb‘r in; in hlngliph, by the prefix un, οιι the
nati astantia rituti ‘statinus
1s stronger than ingratus, and more elegant than ingratissimus.
Moreover, this expression is useful with the many adjectives
