ιο. In medio] Instead of medius being used as an adjective ;
as, in media urbe, ‘in ὼε midst of the city ' (XXXIX. 12) ;it may
pass in the neuter into a noun, as in the text (XI. 4, a). So, too,
may summus; either in summo monle, or in summo moniti, being
ullowable ior ‘ on the top of amountain.’

CHAPTER XLI.

r. Postquain satis] “When all seemed quiet about the
house, and everybody fast asleep.²’ Satis, ‘so that he would not

effected. Hence one noun in the accusative, and the other in
ibe ablative t as, nectare marcet aquas, ‘he mixes the water with
nectar.

4 Positum] Notice the omission ol se aiterait. Thisis
not uncommon. Compare XXXIL 8.

5. Ut-veniant.} “ Begging them come, each with a trusty
friend.'¹ From nuntium, ‘one who carries amessage,’ isextracted
both the verb ol asking, to which venzbnt is subyoined by ut ;
nnd the verb oi telling, after which rem and incidisse are in the
accusative.

6. Conventus] ‘⁴ He had been met.” Conventa, an intrans·
itive verb, meaning ‘corne together ς’ ἰιι which sense it can only
