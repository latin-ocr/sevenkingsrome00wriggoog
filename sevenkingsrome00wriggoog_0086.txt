cunr. xiv. 77

intransitive, meaning literally ‘rise up at :’ but in use it is
transitive, being always followed by the accusative. See note 2,

5. Et esse] “On the one hand, therefore, it was determined
that there should be some head; on the other, no one could
bring his mind to yield to his neighbour.’' These two sentences
exhibit more of contrast than is usual in sentences conjoined by
¹ the simple conjunctions et, et. concedere is in the accusative

after inducebat: ‘No one could bring to his mind yielding to ,

another) The imperfect tense marks the incomplete action:
‘No one was in the way of bringing,' ‘seemed like y to bring.'

6. Alteri] if we take two objects together, ¹alter refers to
one or the other of the two. If we take three or more objects
together, alius refers to any one or other of the whole number.
This distinction, though not absolute, almost always holds As,
then, there were more than two Fathers‚ we might expect alti
here. But alteri is according to rule, because each Father sur·
veyed the whole number in successive groups of two, each con·
taining himself and one other3 and to that other he would not
yield.

7. Singulis] “And appointing one man sor each decury (lot

of ten), to beat the head of affairs.'' Singuli is the first of the ,

distributive numerals, as they are called, those, that is, which
answer to the question quoteni? ‘How many each f' How many
garments have they? Binus vestes habent; ‘they have two ,
garments each.’ Observe how the word is repeated in Latin,
singulis in singulas; where we say, ‘one for each' So the
Latin for ‘a priest to each god,' is singuli singulorum deorum
sacerdotes. Compare hinc-hinc and tum-tum, xl. 7. Singulas
seems to corne from a root sim or sam, meaning ‘one ;' from
which also come simplex, ‘one-fuld ;’ semel, ‘once,' &c ; and -
which we have in the word ‘same'

. 8. Decurias.] The accusative case of decurias depends on the
idea of motion contained in creatis. Theman, it is true, was in
the decury before ; buthe was appointed president into the
decury. So, a little below, in orbem means, ‘so as to complete
the round ;’ that is, ‘one after the other,’ ‘in succession’

9. Qui-praeessent] See Vll. 4 For the tense, 1. 12. ,

ro. Interregnum.] “That inter-val was called from the
actual lactan inter-regnum, which name it retains to this day.’'

rr. Nec ultra] “Nor did they seem any longer inclined to
put up witly anything except a king, and that, one created by
thzmsplyplsigh the subject-word plebs is in the singular number,
videbantur and pusmrr' are rightly in the plural, because plebs
is what is called a collective noun, ora noun of multitude ε that
