4 Omnibus ] Som'e intransitive verbs, as sto, ‘stand' denote

an action which hardly lyvpears capable of affecting an object;
and after these we sha find no noun at all. Others denote
an action which can be conceived as in some way affecting an
obj ect; and after these, unless there' ιι something ιιι the verb
which requires another case, we shall always expect to find the
noun naming such object m the dative. Thus ιιι the text
omnibus rs in the dative after musei. For if an object rs spoken
of as remaining to ‘'all, or for all' to use, ‘'all maybe con·
ceived as acted on indirectly by it, being affected by its so
rgmgininffi ,end therefore the word naming ‘'all may be put in
te ativecase.

6. Latino] The first of the two laws for the ablative is, the
object from which motion is directed has its noun in the ab·
lative case. Hence verbs or adjectives, which in any way

The son comes from the father. Hence the participles natus,
genitus, ortus (asin the text), are followed hythe ablative

&c.; as arceo, libero, preire, orbus, vacuus, &c With some
words the preposition may be used or not, indifferently

can only be ascertained by practice.

7. Ad posteros] The preposition ad denotes that the 'name
(Tiberis, ‘the Tiber') came down to‘ men of after time,' and
was famous among them.

objects that can be actually held ιιι the hand, as a book; but to

objects passed ιιι any way from one to another To a kingdom ἵ

9 Colli fecit] This rs a good example of a verb followed by
two nouns, because it denotes an action that operates on two
objects (11.5) Facrb rs not generally given as a verb that governs

the dative as well as the accusative, because there* 1s seldom 3

occasion to mention more than the object made. But tm the
text, Aventinus madeaname for the hrll name ’has ιιι noun
