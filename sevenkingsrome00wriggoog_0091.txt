'also comes ali-quis, ‘some one ⁹), there 'seems no reason why
alius should not also mean ‘one or the other of tw0,’ except so
far as in use it is excluded from this meaning by alter being
confined to it. But in use alius would seem sometimes to have
this meaning. Thus in the text there are'only two kings spoken
of, so that we might expect alter altera vt'rz. But perhaps the
use of alius may be thus explained. Though the kings have been
marked as only tw0‚ the ways have not. The two kings might
strengthen their country in more ways than two. The ways are
not marked as only two till the next line, ille bello, hz'c pace.
Therefore altit, not altera, is used with via: and, as usage re·
'quires the same word, alius, not alter, is used with rex. But if
the ways had been first marked as only two-as, duo reges
duobus, vizi-then alter altero via would probably have been
written, as in Cicero: Istis oratoribus duoe res maxima altera
altera deficit. (Brut 55.) But see XXI. 12.

2. Alius.alia.] The following constructions of alius and alter
should be observed :-

a. When alius or alter occurs twice in the same sentence, that
sentence is frequently translated twice over in English3 as in
the text: also, discedebmrt alius in aliam partem ‘they sepa-
rated, one to one side, another to another :’ dilapsi sunt alii
'alirn ‘they slipped off, some 'by one route, some by another :'
hoec alr'ter ab aliis dqtniuntur ,· ‘these things are defined in one
way by some, in another way byssothers ς’ istri duoe res maxima
altera alteri deficit,' ‘to these two orators those two important
qualifications are wanting, one to the one, the other to the
other.

b. When alius occurs iu two following sentences, it is translated
by ‘one '- ‘ another;' and in the plural by ‘some'-‘ others :' as,
aliud Caius loquatur, elaad sentit; ‘Caius says one thing, and
means another ε’ qua minus tuta erant, alte firssrlr, alia vallas,
:alia turribus muniebat; “the unsafe rts he strengthened, some
with ditches, some with mounds‚ 0 ers with towers.'’ Alter—
alter is translated by ‘the one’-‘ the other :' as, alteram ille
>amat sorerem, ego alteram ,· ‘he loves the one sister, I the other.’

c. When only one alim is used, it means ‘another,' ‘other ;'
hence, ‘different' When only one alter is used, it means, ‘the
other of two 3¹ hence, ‘the second :' as, alternet vicesimo annm
‘in the twenty-second year.' ’

d. In the plural alteri means, ‘one of the two parties, classes,
‚nations &c τ’ as, alteri alteros obtriverant, ‘each nation had
damaged the other! See VII. 11.

3. Ille-hic.] As hic means ‘this by me ’—in time or place;
ille, ‘that by some=third¹person’-·and, therefore, further from
met a writer, speaking·0f past objects‚ calls ‘the latter' hic, as
nearer himself ; *the former’ ule, as further away.
