sessor 3’ for the cause is a passive possessor oi the effect that is
come out of it, and still belongs to it.

12. Addit sceleri] “He adds crime to crime. His brother’s
sons he puts out of the way. From his brothers daughter,
Rhea Silvia, having, under the show ol honour, elected her a
Vestal, he takes away hope of offspring by (imposing on her)
lilelong virginity.’' The words per speciem honon's belong rather
to the subjoined than to the main clause. Quum need not be the
first word in the clause which it subjoins.

13. Interimit.] Emo meant, originally, ‘take,' though in use
it has only the special sense ‘take by purchase ;' that is, ‘buy'
But in the compounds it has only the original sense ‘take ;’
as exim, ‘take out of,' ‘take away ;’ denso (de), ‘take down,'
‘take offi' ‘take away3’ sunto (sub), ‘take up;’ promo (pro),
‘take out,' ‘put forward3’ como (cum), ‘put together‚’ ‘arrange’
So interimo means ‘take from among? hence, ‘do away with ;’
a soft way os expressing ‘destroy, ‘kill,’ which is the only
meaning of the word in use. Observe that the e of ento becomes
i in comjjositiom as in assalito, from sedco,· dirigo from rego ;
abstineo, om teneo. ¹

dre. ;whatever be the preposition by which such nouns are con-
nected in English3 as sor, at, towards, of, &c

15. Animis] Adimo (ad) means literally (13) ‘take tomyselfj'

hence, ‘take from another,’ and generally ‘take away! This r
verb will show the faultiness 'of the rule commonly given in ,
mmars: ‘Verbs compounded with prepositions govern the 3
tive' Is the dative after odioso depended in the least on the ζ
proposition ad, adimo could onl mean ‘take to,’ as in addit r

just above Ad could not possibly lose its proper senseinoorn- ς
Epsition, and mean ‘from’ The lact is, that verbs should never 1

spoken of as governing cases. Such an expression makes l
ns lose srght os what cases are—mere forms which the nonn' j

assumes in order to show the circumstances in which the object

named b the noun is placed. Thus in the sentence Amulius t
addo sceeri scelus, ‘Amulius puts a new crime by the side of {

the old crime,' ‘new crime’ has its noun in the accusative, sor
it is spoken os as moved by Amulius, just as in the sentence ’

oddr'taquomflommae, ‘water isspoken ol asmoved3 ‘old crime' =
