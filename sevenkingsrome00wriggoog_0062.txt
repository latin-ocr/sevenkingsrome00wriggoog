the same principle, in the sentence filioe spem adimit, ‘hope' has

its noun in the accusative, because itis moved; ‘daughter' has

her noun in the dative, because she is affected by the hope being

taken away. Whether I say, filia udo spem, or filioe adimo spem,

Ehe daughter is alike stationary‚ aud alike operated on indirectly

CHAPTER IV.

L Sed debebatur] “But due, as I conceive, to the fates
was the origin of so great a city, and the beginning os an empire

second only to the majesty oi the gods3 ' literally‚ ‘greatest
aster the power of the gods.’ Debeo is a transitive verb ; as debeo
pecum‘am, ‘I owe money.' There is a passive therefore3 as
pecunia debetur, ‘money is owed,' or ‘owing' or ‘due' And
here the origin oi Rome is spoken ol as due or owing to the

4 Circa] Circa, as ‘around’ in English, is both preposition‚
as circa salamanna belowj and adverb, as here. Though
perhaps here it may be rather considered as an indeclinable

5. Invenerit] “Suckled them so teuderly, that the king's
herdsman found her licking them with her tongue.’' Compare
this use of the subjunctive with its primary use, as explained
in note II. 8. There the verb in the subjunctive denoted an
action that was not spoken of as taking place Here the action
