CHAPTER XX.

1. Sua quisque] Quisque is osten introduced into the sen·
tence in apposition with the subject-word ; as here with fratres,

< the understood subject-word to dimz'cent. ‘With these bro·

thers the hings treat, that they should fight, each lor his own
country, with the sword’ So, metues suas quisque abeunt dom0s;
‘the soldiers go away every one of them to their own homes? -
Sometimes the verb agrees in number with quisque, instead of
its proper subject-word: as, pictores et poeta suum quisque opus
a augo conuilerari uult. (Cic. Off. Ι. 14.) Notice also that

quisque comes immediately after suus.

2. imperium] “Proposing that the sovereignty should be
on th‘at side stom which the victory should proceed’'

3. Dimic'arent.] See XIX. 9.

- 4. Ut cujus] “ That the people, whose citizens should con·
quer (or, conquered)1n that combat, should rule over the other
with good faith.”

a. Though the relative is strictly an adjective, yet it is com·
monly used without its noun. Its noun, il inserted, would be
the antecedent. Thus in the sentence ; homo, quem misi, dicet,-
qusm agrees with iuncinum understood: homo, quem (hominem)
misi, dz'cit, ‘the man, which (man) Isent, says.’ But this noun
isso seldom inserted, that our rule lor the relative must be :—
‘ In gender and number the relative agrees with its antecedent r
t'or its case, it depends on its own position as a noun in the
relative clayse. It also transmits to its verb the person os its
antecedent
' b. Sometimes, however, the noun is inserted, and then the
antecedent is generally omitted srom its own sentence; as,

uem hominem misi, deit ; a torm which we cannot translate
literally into En lish. So, quem ceperant exsules montem, herbrilus
est ; ‘the hill which the exiles had occupied is grassy.’ And so,
in the text, populi is inserted in the relative clause, bnt the
antecedent populus is omitted.

5. Vicissent.] Suppose the conditions were, ‘The people,
which conquers, shall rule 3’ the Latin, in oratio directa, would
bez is, qui metit, popetlus imperitabat. Not vina't, ‘conquers,’
as we oarelessly say: nor vincet, ‘shall conquer,' as we might
say; and as would seem correct, sor the conquering is future:
but cauit, ‘shall have conquered,’ the future-perfect indicative,
beccum the conquering will be persected before the ruling
comm into operation. Now suppose this condition were nar·‚
