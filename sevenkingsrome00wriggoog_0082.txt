enne. xn. 73

omitted, than mea with negatam which would be au absurd
ellipsis: as is omnib nostra abstulit meant, ‘he carried off all
our businesses.’

4 Plus poterant] Plus is in the accusative after poterant :
just as in the sentence, possum (or capi) ambulare, ambulare is
in the accusative after possum (or capi). Plus and ambulare
name the objects on which the action denoted by posnam or (capi)
operates directly. There is, therefore, no need to understand
facere after poterant. So tantum, a little below, isin the accu-
sative after valuit.

5. Illorum] Ille means, ‘that yonder.’ Illorum, therefore,
implies, ‘those people with whose action he had nothing to do? '
Ille, iste, hic, is, δια, are adJectives, which pass readily into
nouns by help of theIr gender: just as the adjective'Romanus,
‘Roman' passes into the nouns Romanus, ‘a Roman man ;’
Romana, ‘a Roman woman! Butthey go further than Romanus:
for as there was no occasion to speak of a single ‘Roman thing,’
there is uo neuter noun Romanum. But as there was frequent
occasion to speak of ‘that thing‚' there is a neuter noun illud
(arud, &ek Thus, theu, there is both the adjective ille passing
through genders; as ille, illa, illud: aud there are the three
nouus, ille, illa, illud ,· meaning respectively ‘that man,’ ‘that
woman,’ ‘that thing3' which may often be translated by our
three nouns, ‘he,' ‘she,' ‘it’

6. Quum-venisset] “ Having gone thither. ''

a. The English compound for the perfect active participle is
usually translated into Latin by the pluperfect subjunctive with
quum, when the verb is intransitive 3 and when the corresponding
Latin verb is not a deponent. When the verb is transitive, the
construction, called ablative absolute, may be used equally well
(H. VIII. 19). Thus, ‘having gone,’quum venarum ‘having set
out‚' profectus; ‘having killed the enemy,' occiso hoste, or quum
hostem occidaiset.

b. When the subjunctive construction is used, it should, as
usual, denote that the action is in some way or other explanatory
of the main action (Note 1). But it has so completely passed
into a phrase, that the connection is often very remote, evenis it
exists at all. Iu the text there is no connection between his
going thither, and his being killed: but there is between his
going thither, and his beIng killed at Lavinium. The clause
quum-venisset shows how it was that he carne to be killed at
Lavinium.

c. The tense of venisset is owing to interficitur being in the
historical present; if the main verb were really in the present,
the subjoined verb would be venerit.

7. Unde viribus] “ On the strength of which Rome became
