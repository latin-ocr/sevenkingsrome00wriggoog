with the preceding word. This enclitic ce, abbreviated from
ecce, ‘lo,' ‘behold‚’ is often added to demonstratives for the
sake of emphasis: as here, ‘this war in which we are now
engaged’ Ille with ce becomes illis, illaec, illuc. So iste becomes
istic, alfrec, istuc. But hic is itself compounded of an old
demonstrative (stem ho, likea nonn of the ο declesion) and ce.
In the declension of the word, as we now have it, we find some
of the old cases without the ce; as hujus, and the plural cases,
except lraec: while the other old cases have disappeared, and
left compounds in their stead3 as, hic, lraec, leoc; hur‘c, hunc
(hum-c, the m being changed into n, as in eun-dem), hane, lroc, ,
hac. To these compounds it is not usual to add ce again,
though it is occasionally added, all idea of the derivation being
lost: but to the other cases ce is frequently added 3 as leusio-ce,
fri-ce, lue-cc or lraec, dcc.

13. Eadem prae te.] “Nor do I doubt that you, Tullus,
profess the same ε ” literally, ‘hold the same before you.'

' 14. Dictu speciosa] Literally, ‘fair in the telling ε’ dr'ctu,
or the supine in u, as it is called, being the ablative of a noun
formed from the verb. Of this verbal the only other caseis
the accusative dictum, commonly called the supine in um ;
which is used after verbs of motion, like the names os towns,
without a preposition: as, ieruntlr’omum, ‘they went to Rome;'
ierunt venatum, ‘they went to hunt.’ So, legatos pacem petitum
mr‘ttunt; ‘they send ambassadors to sue for peace.

15. Imperii] Observe that Livy does not use the contracted
form; as, imperi, serrati. This was used by old writers, and is
Qffispund in Virgil and Horace. Afterwards it grew out ol

16. Utri utris] “By which maygbe decided which of the
two peoples is to rule the other.'' Alter means ‘one or the
other of two ;' uter, ‘which of two ς’ neuter, ‘neither the one
nor the other ;' uterque, ‘either the one or the other,’ ‘both’
Of two persons I ask, uter dignior? Of more than two, quis
dignissimus? So, of two, you answer, uterque dagnus ‚· of more
than two, omnes· digni. As alter is combined with alter ; as,
alter alteri imperat, ‘the one rules the other ς’ so uter is com-
bined with uter; as, uter utra imperat, ‘ which rules which i'

In the plural, utri, as usual, means ‘which of the two parties,'·

17. Displicet] Verbs are called transitive, when they denote
an action which passes on directly from the subject to some
other object, so as to move or change it ; intransitive, when
they denote an action which does not so pass (Ι. 9). Now,
when the action is performed by the body, rt is tolerably clear
whether it passes directly or not But when the action is not
