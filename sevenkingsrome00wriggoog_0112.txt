pride with which this accession of wealth inspired him was in-
creased by his marriage with Tanaquil, alady of the highest
birth ; and one who would not readily suffer the condition, into

which she had married, to be inferior to that in which she bad
been bom! See IV. 12.

2. innupsisset] A very rare word, and one after which the
dative might possibly be expected. But the accusative is quite
- intelligible, just as it is after invado, incedo, dcc. (XIV. 2). In·
nubo therefore means, ‘enter by marriage’

1113 6Ertsule.] “As the son of an exile and a foreiguer.'' See ,

4. Carpento] In the ablative‚ as naming an object sub-
sidiary to the sitting. The preposition in is commonly placed
before nouns (not names of towns or small islands) that name
the place in or ot which an action is performed. But the object
on which I sit or stand or wear, or carry anything (X. 6), or per·
form any similar action, has perhaps more commonly its noun
in the ablative, without a preposition; for it is more clearly
mentioned as subsidiary to the action. It is almost the instru-
ment by which the action is performed. It is a very nice point
to distinguish whether or not a preposition should be placed
before a noun in the ablative. On this head it may be re·
marked: 1. After some verbs it seems a matter of indifference.
2. After others the usage os the hest writers has established a
preference. 3. Prefix the prepositi0n‚ when otherwise there
might be ambiguity. 4 Do not prefix it, when the objectis
put forward as essential to the performance of the action.

5. suspensis] “Dropping lightly down on floating wings”
Suspensus, literally‚ ‘hung up,' ‘suspended' gives the notion of
‘loose,' ‘light ;’ as of a thing floating lightly in the air. Simi-
larly‚ suspenso grado ire means, ‘to walk on tiptoe.' Demitto
means, ‘I let down ’—an object ; detnittor, ‘I am let down '-by
some object3 among others, by myself 3 that is, ‘let myself
down.y Many verbs have in the passive this middle sense.

· 6. Ministerio.] “As if sent from heaven to perform the
office.’' See XXI. 4

7. Petita] See XV. 4

8. Venisse] Observe the tenses of venisse and portendere.
Tanaquil's words were, oles vonit, ‘the bird is come‚’ the coming
being past: regnum portendit (pres), ‘it portends a crown,’ the
portending being present. Which tenses are preserved in oratio

&pylum according to the rule given Vll. 15, o. See also H.
. 15.

9. Belli domique] Probably, old datium, the dative origin·
ally denoting ‘att’ see ‘Steps,' lnt. 24. Such are dorni, baroti,
