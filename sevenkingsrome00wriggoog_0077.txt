seldom followed by a noun in the accusative, and therefore
comesto be regarded as intransitive. And this holds still more
in the passive ι for, as neither you nor Ι are likely to be obtained
by request‚ the third person only is used. And in this person
the impersonal construction, as it is called, is almost always
adopted. That is, the verb is used without a subject-word, or
only such subject-word as may be su plied from a neighbouring
sentence. And this of course wo d be regarded as of th'e
neuter gender. Thus in the text we might supply, id quod ora·
verrat impetratum est ,· ‘what she asked for was readily obtained!

6. Minus—certaminis] Observe this neuter adjective used
like a noun; and, as such, followed by a noun in the genitive
case. Minus certamlnlr'means literally, ‘less of fighting:'
certaminis being in the genitive as naming the whole, that
possesses ‘the less’ as a part. lt is possible forus to use ‘less’
as a noun in Fjuglish3 but we generally keep itan adjective: as,
‘lessfi hti .

a. Birt jhg Latin adjectives deuotiug quantity‚—as multum,
plurimum, ult'quantum (XXI. 18), tantum, &c (not magnum or
paruum),-are generally used in this way as nouns, when we
wish to give prominence to the quantity of an object, rather
than to the object itself. So, too, are the pronominal adjectives z
as lzoc rei (XXXV. 3), siquid auri, quod campi (XI. 1), &c
These adjectives may be used as nouns either in the nominative
or accusative case; but not when a preposition precedes. We
must say, ml lantum laborm, not ad tuntum laboris.

b. After such adjectives used as' nouus we may also have

neuter adjectives of the first class in the genitive case: as album l

boni, plurimum novi, si quid pulchri, &c z and these must also

be regarded as nouus. But we may not have adjectives of the j

second class. We must say, aliquid memorabile, not aliquid
memoraldlls.

7. Cladibus] Under the general class of nouns naming sub·
sidiary objects, and therefore in the ablative case, come, as a

special class, nouus which name the cause why an action is per· ζ

formed. Multi homines efficia deserunt mollitia animi ; ‘Many

men desert their duty through feebleness of mind! Molla'ttb is ¹

in the ablative, as naming the cause why men desert their duty.
So in the text cladibus isin the ablative, as naming the cause
why the spirits of the Crustuminians had fallen Compare pre·
cibus fatigata and vz'ctorm ovantem, a little above.

8. Qui darent] “To give in their names'’-as colonists.
They did actually give in their names; so that darent is in the
subjunctive, in accordauce with the secondary, not the primary,
use of the mood, its dependence on inuenti being verbal, not real

(IV. 5)-
