4 Juris.] In the genitive after conmltissimus. The geni-
tive of the‘ passive possessor comes properly, and in the first
instance‚·after the nouns which name the objects possessed:
as, scientia juris, ‘acquaintance with law ;' pen'tia belli, ‘expe-
rience in war3’z'gnoratr'0 veri, ‘ignorance of truth3’ mernm'a
beneficii, ‘recollection of a kindness’ (III. 11). But this con·
structionis commonly extended to adjectives which correspond
in meaning with such nounsr so that adjectives denoting
knowledge, experiente, &c and the reverse, are followed by the
genitive: as, connaltusjm's, ‘acquainted with law ς’ pm'tus belli,
‘experienced in war3’ ignarus ver-i, ‘ignorant of the truth ;'
memor beneficii, ‘mindfnl of a kindness.’ We have seen (VI. 5)
how, on the same principle, adjectives denoting fondness, desire,
dic, are followed by the genitive.

ς. Inclinati] Inclino, ‘bend down,’ or ‘towards’ is both
transitive3 as, inclino ad dextrum caput, sol re inclinat: and in·
transitive3 as, sol inclinat. From the transitive use comes the
pashsive form inclinor, ‘am bent down,’ or ‘towards' ‘incline,'
as ere.

xpv Agd unum] ‘All to a man,'-so as to make one. Compare

1. Potitus] See V. 7.

2. Eam] Notice this introduction of the logical demon·
strative ir after a participle. It would 'be more usual aftera
relative clauses as, quam Romulus vi condiderat. It points out
the city, not with reference to its situation or date, but with
reference to what has been said about it in the narrative
(XV. ι). ‘The new city, founded, as I hare described, ou
violence and arms-this new city, Ι say, he prepares tn found
anew on justice, and law, and virtue’

3. De integro] See XI. 5.

4. Desuetudine.] “By disune of anns :'' the arms possessing
the disuse passively, as a thing applied to them (ΙΙΙ. 11). Com·
pare the prepositions ad and dein composition. Assuesco (al-³
