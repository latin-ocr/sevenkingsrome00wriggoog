For it seems to have originally meant, ‘I am ma'de powerful ;’
or reflectively, ‘I make myself powerful.’ Theobject, then, by
which Ι make myself powerful would naturally have its noun in
the ablativa, as being the subsidiary object, or means. And as
the best way to make myself powerful by means of an object is
to possess myself of it, potor comes to have the transitive mean·

ing, ‘acquire' ‘obtain Besides ponar, the following deponente,
which are translated into English by transitive verbs, take the
ablative, and for similar reasons ; vir. utor, ‘use ; ' fruor, ‘enjoy ;’
fiaengor, ‘discharge’ Potabr is also found with the genitive
in poetry3 more rarel in prose, except in the phrase, patrer
rerum, ‘I make myse master of the govemment.'

2. Quum—tum] Notice this phrase sor translating the
English, ‘not only-but especially.' If filled up, it would be:
se, quum cetero habitu augeatiorem fecisset, tum maxime, &a

3. Cujus ne vana] “And that its size might not be nse
less, Romulus, with the view of attracting population, operted
a certain place with privilege of sanctuary.' The ablative
causa (or palia), with a noun in the genitive or a possessive,

Asylum (from a, ‘not' and σνλιίω, ‘rob’j means, literally, a
place ‘safe from robbers τ’ hence, ‘sanctuary,' a place under
divine protection and safe from harm of all kinds, a place of
refuge. It then beoanm a place in which debtors might be safe
from creditors, and criminals from justice.

4. Discrimina] As we had the nounfisma followed by an
accusative and infinitive, just like a verb (V. 5j; so here we
have the noun discrima followed, like a verb, by a subjoined
clause. ‘Without distinction, whether a man was slave or free'
The Latin for ‘whether-or' is art-an. But the first an is
frequently omitted, as in the text. Care must be taken not to
translate ‘or' by aut in such a subjoined clause.
