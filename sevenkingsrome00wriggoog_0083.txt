preposition in im lies, not duration but motion, from the period
of those success wars, through and to the end of the forty
years.

8. liaberet] See VII. 33 and observe that th'e imperfect
lobna, as esset there, denotes, not asingle persected action, but
a state or condition

9. oration] We have seen that when an intransitive verb (as
cedo, 11. 113 maneo, 111. 45 prunam, x ι) denotes an action,
by which an object is affected, the noun naming the object is
put in the dative case And, on exactly the same principle,
when an adjective denotes a quality, which affects or concertis

an object, the noun naming such object will be 'in the dative ι,

case. Multitudini gratus rex fuit ; ‘the king was popular with
the common people.’ Clearly the common people were affected
by the king being popular. Their feelings were influenced
thereby. Therefore multitudini isin the dative after gratus.
And whenever an adjective denotes a quality, by which an
object may be influenced or affected, we may expect to find it
followed by a noun in the dative case. But we shall have to
explain why certain adjectives are followed by nouns in the
genitive or abiative See H. p. 146.

1o. Acceptissimus.] Notice the participle in the superlative,
like any other adjective. So, wlgathr, V. 4„ For the dative
case, see last note

CHAPTER XIII.

1. Quum-haberet] We can hardly have a sentence in ’

which the force of the subjunctive is less apparent than here.

Quum luberet seems at first sight to mean nothing more than ᾗ
quum habebat, ‘at the time when he was holding! For his ;

holding an assembly can have nothing to do with the main

action, a storm covering him. And if the sentence stopped at 1
nimbo (tam being omitted), there would seem no reason at all 1
for the subjunctive But it goes on, ‘the etonn covered him with

eo thick a cloud as to take away the sight of him from the j

assembly.’ Here, then, in the word corurhni seems the clue to
the subjunctive. The clause quum-liaberet tells us how it came
to pass that the assemhly saw him no more, ‘since at the time
he was holding an assembly for the purpose ol reviewing his
army.' Is the word were hominibus, or Romanis, instead of
