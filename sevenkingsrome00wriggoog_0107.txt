4 Propius] Though there is no adjective in Latin meaning
Α ‘nean' but only the comparative propior, ‘nearer,’ and the
superlative pommus, ‘nearest ς’ there are the three forms oi
the adverb, prope, propius, and proxime. After both adjective
and adverb the dative is the natural case; for, if we are near
an object, that object is certainly not moved, but is affected by
our neemess. But beside its use as an adverb, prope (like circa)
is also a preposition; and, as such, is followed by an accusative,
the dative not being used in Latin after prepositions. And not
only so, but propius and proxirm are also used as prepositions,
and as such are followed by the accusative: as indeed are
occasionally the adjectives propior and proximus.

5. miracula] “At first the Romans, who had been standing
nearest, were astonished.'’ For the dative miraculo, see ΧΧΙ. 10:
for the infinitive esse, see IV. 10. The subject-word of the
sentence must be understood from the adjoined clause-⁶ the
fact of their flanks being uncovered.'

6. Salios] Numa's Twelve Salii (xvi.) were distinguished
as Palatini, because they were attached to the Temple of Mars
on the Palatine Hill: these as Collini (understand Quirinales),
because their sacred place was in colle Quirinali. They were
probably dedicated to the service of Quirinus. The Salii were
so called (from salia), because in their solemn processions they
daneed and leapt.

7. Pallori] The natives of Benares having erected temples
to Warren Hastings, this fact was pleaded in his favour at his
trial in Westminster Hall. Burke's reply well illustratas the
feeling with which Tullus would at such a moment vow tem·
ples to Pallor and Panic. “He saw (Budre said, as quoted in
Macaulay’s Essays) no reason for astonishment He knew
something of the mythology of the Brahmins. He knew that,
as they worshipped some gods from love, so they worshipped
others frorn fear. He 'knew that 'they erected shrines, not only
to the benignant delties of light and plenty, but also to the
hends who preside over small-porr aud murder. Nor did he at

aupdijjjme pre claim of Mr. Hastings to be admitted into such
a au eon.

ἃ Imperat] a. Ira-piro (from in and patro) means ‘put
upon ;’ just as com-paro means ⁴put together;' separo, ‘put
asunder ;’ propero, ‘put before! Hence impero means ‘im-
pose as a tax3 as, prooiriaoe tributum imperat, ‘he imposes a
tribute on the province 3' and generally, ‘orden’ ‘command’ In
this sense it is usually followed by ut, as in the text (vn. 16) ;
whereas jubeo is usually followed by the infinitiva
