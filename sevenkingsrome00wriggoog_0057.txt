Then comes the adjoined clause, quamquam-eran to which the
clause ret-implesset is subjoined. And theu, again, comes the
clause quum-posset, subjoined by quum to the main verb musa.

15. Quamquam] Relative forms are often doubled in

Latin Thus from qui we have isqmi, ‘whoever‚' ‘no matter ,

who! So from quam, ‘how,' a orm of qui, we have quanquam
(or quanquam), ‘however‚’ ‘no matter bow‚’ ‘although' Ob·
serve that quamquam is followed by the indicative, and is there-
fore an adjoining conjunction. And take as a rule: ‘When

16. opibus] This noun, in the singular, means ‘might,' ι
‘help ς’ in the plural, ‘rescurces,' ‘powen’ ‘wealth’ The ²

verbs of the 'second conj ation, which form the perfect and
partici le after the model o ama and audio (H. V. 8).

a. hese verbs, and verbs of the first conjugation, admit, in
the perfect tenses, of the following abbreviation (chiefly found in
poetry) ι ‘The letter a and the following vowel may be leit out,
provided that no confusion be caused thereby.’ Thus you have

ιιι the text implesset for impleuisset ; and you may have amarunt ’

for amaverunt. But not amare for amavere, because it would

be confused with the infinitiva So you may not shorten amavi Ἴ

into ama, nor amavimus into amamus.
b. Similarly we find nosti, mmmdcc, for mariti, numeram, dre.
(but always novera) ; also commosse for conventrense, dre.

¹ c. In the fourth coujugation the v onlyis dropped, as aum, ¹

audieram, except before s, when both may be dropped3 as
audisti, audissem, audisse, petisse. In poetry, however, the forms
audiam, petiisse, are preferred.

18. Quum—posset] Quum ‘when’ ‘at which time? a η

word denoting time, formed from qui ; is both an adjoining and
a subjoining conjunctiou.

a. When it introduces a fact altogether independent of the
main fact, it is an adjoining conjunction, and as such is followed
by the indicative mood; as, quum AEneas in Italiam venit, Lati·

nus Laurentem agrmm regebat. The coming of AEneas is not ’

mentioned as in any way dependent on the ruling of Latinus.

After quum-amit, many other things might have been said ς for ¹

instance, Turnus mx Rutulmmm erat.
b. But when quum introduces a fact dependent on, crin any

way connected with, the main fact, it isa subjoining conjunc·
