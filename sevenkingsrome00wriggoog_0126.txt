parative sentences; tutmhr emt tyrannus quam quisquam supe-
riorum =‘Not one of his predecessors was so foul a tyrant as
he :² witlilr ’the prepositi0n siue ,¹ siue ullo auxilio = ‘he has no
hel ata.

'li I‘t thus appears that ullus and quisquam mean ‘any,’ when
all other objects of the same class are excluded : whereas quivis
and yurlibet, which'also may be translated by ‘any,’ mean ’
‘any when all are included (VII. 1). Naucuz'm'spotestaccidere ,
quad cumuam patest; ‘what may happen to any oue, may not
huppen to any you please' that is, ‘to all'

c. Aliquis means ‘some’ quite generally, without giving the
idea of ‘single’ as ullus does. Quemsequur? Quamlibet, neoda
aliquem,⁸ ‘anybody you please, so that it is only some one'

8. Praeda] For this dative, see XXL 10.

10. Per ambages.] Amdagas isa defective noun3 only the
ablativo ambage being found in the singular. The plural is
complete 3 but the genitive is ambagum, not ambagium (VII. 2).
The word is compounded of ambi, or amb, ‘round,’ and ug0;
and therefore means literally, a ‘driving or going round‚'
‘roundabout way ς’ hence, ‘shufflIng’ ‘quibbles,’ ‘enigmas'
Per ambages, therefore, means, ‘in a roundabout (or, enigma·
tical) wa.

The pieposition ambi is only found in composition. It is the
same as the Greek daal, ‘round' and is connected with amba,
‘ both ι ' an object which is mund another being on bath sides of
it. From ambi come our words ambiguous and ambitium.

11. Incessit] With the accusative ς see XIV. 2.

12. Ex Infima] An adjective is sometimes joined with a
noun, so as to distinguish‚ not the object named by the noun
from other objects‚ but one part of the object from its other
parts. Thus, summus mam means ‘the top of a mountain‚’ as
distinguished from the other parts; extrema imula, ‘the ex-
tremity of the island? in mem'a urbe, ‘in the middle of the
town :’ reliquum apris, ‘the rest of the work τ’ ex infimo specu,
‘from the bottom of the cave'
