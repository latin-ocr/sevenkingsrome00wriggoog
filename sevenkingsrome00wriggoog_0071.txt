3. Ut-esset.] Ut in the text subjoius, not a purpose, but
a result. The subjunctive, therefore, is used, notin its primary,
but in its secoudary sense ; the dependeuce denoted by it being
not real, but only verbal (IV. 5). As au historical fact, Rome
was now a match for any of the neighbouring states; and, if
Livy had stated this fact by itself‚ he would have used the indi-
cative mood, par erat. But in the sentence he subjoins this fact
to another, which he makes the main fact: ‘Rome was now so
strong that she was a match' Audin Latin, though not in
English, this verbal dependence requires the subjunctive meod,

The tense of esset is iu accordanoe with the usual law for the
sequence of tenses (Ι. 12). But sometimes the perfect subjunc-
tive is used after ut, ‘so that,' as in IV. 5, This is allowable
(though not usual) wben a single perfectas action is spoken of, as
that of the herdsman finding the wolf ; but not when a state or
condition is denoted by the verb, as in the text. Thns for, ‘He
ran so fast that he was iu a sweat,’ the Latin is, itu cucurrit ut
sudaret, not sudaverit.

4 Quii-peterentj “To seek allianoe ;’' literally, ‘who
should see . '

a. Of the words used in Latin to join subordinate clauses in
the main sentence ; that is, of adjoining and subjoining conjunc·
tions; by far the most important are the relative adjective qui,
and the adverbs derived from it These adverbs are :-

(1) Of place: quo, ‘to which place,' ‘whither ;' unde (origin-
ally eunde), ‘from which place,' ‘whence ς’ ubi (originally cuba),
‘at which place,' ‘where 3' qua', ‘by which road'

(2) Of time: quum aud quando, ‘at which time‚' ‘when’

(3) Of manner, &cz ut (originally cut), ‘in which manner,'
‘as,' ‘how ;' quare (qua re), or cur, ‘for which cause,' ‘why ;’
and some others.

b. We have frequently met with qui as an adjoining conjunc·

tion: as, Palatucm, in quo aspre erat educatus, muniet; creat ³

solutores, qui Patres appellari, in the last chapter. So, in iis
locri, ubi expositi erant, urbis condenda, dcc, V. 1. In all these
sentences, the verb in the relative clause is quite independeut
of the main verb. It denotes an action that is spoken of as
'really taking place, and without bearing on the main actIon.
Hence the relative verb is in the indicative mood. And when
it is, we say that it is adjoined, not subjoined; andjthe word
which adjoins it, whether the adjective qui, or au adverb
derived from qui or any other word, we call an adjoining
conjunction.

c. But qui in the text we call a subjoining conjunction,
because peterentis in the subjunctive mood ι And peterent has
the primary sense of the subjunctive (II. 8), as it denotes a
purpose conceived iu the mind, not afact that is spoken of as
