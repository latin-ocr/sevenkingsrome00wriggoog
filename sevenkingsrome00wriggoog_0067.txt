as combined into single nouos by a hyphen, like respublica,
‘state,' or jin-jurandum, ‘oath :' as N. urbs-condenda (or urbs·
cmcdita), ‘city-building;' G. urmeondendas D. urbi-condendae,
&cz Pl. G. urbium-condendarum, &c

Beside urbm-condense, we might have in the text urbem con-
dendi: that is, the gerund, which, being active in signification,
is followed by a noun in the accusative case. This construction,
however, though it has exactly the same (imperfect) meaning as
urbis condenda, is not so commonly used by the best writers.

places to take the auguries in.” In the sentence the main verb
is capiunt, which isin the historical present, and therefore the
subjoined verbs are in the imperfect subjunctive (I. 12).

a. These subjoined verbs all imply dependence, more or less,
on the main action, though in different ways. Dependence may
be regarded both as before and afler; as the cause, and as the
purpose, or result. The clause quantem gemini essent denotes
dependence defore—the cause. ‘Since they were twins,' they had
recourse to some plan fordeciding between them,— ‘ they se ected
spots to take auguries in' The clause nec—posset is exactly in
the same position as the former, being conjoined to it by the et
in nec, nec being equivalent to et nen. Posset, then, and essent,
being conjoined by et, are subjoined by quonism to capiunt.

b. Next comes the clause ret—legerent, subjoined to capiant by
ut, and denoting dependence after-the purpose. This is the
primary use of the subjunctive; the action not being spoken of
as actually taking place(II. 8, and IV. 5). Then comes the clause
qui-daret. This is subjoined by qui, not to the main sentence,
but to the subordinate clause ut—legerent. It also denotes de-
pendence afler-the purpose. Giving a name to the city is men-

tionedasthe purpose or end of the gods choosing. Last comes ¹

qui-regeret; which is subjoined to set-legerent exactly in the
same way as qui-daret is. Instead, however, of being conjoined
to qui-daret by a conjoining conjunctior, it is sufficiently, and
more emphatically, conjoined by being placed by its side.

3. Templa] Among the signs by which the gods were sup·
posed to communicate their will to men, none held a more

prominent place than those afforded by the voice and the flight ἦ

of birds. The giving such signs on the part ol the gods, and
the taking or making them out on the part os men, as well as
the actual signs themselves, received the names of augurium, a
word probably connected with avis, ‘bird ;’ and summeium, a

word certainly compounded of avis and the root spec ‘see' ,
