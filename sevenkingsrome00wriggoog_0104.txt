lcase: as, muninipetn's tui, ‘ 1 remember you‘r' father ;‘ obliviscor
'' efficii, ‘I forget my duty3 ' admoneo te egestatis, ‘I remind you of
= your guverty ;’ memor patrie, oblitus patrie, dcc. '

b. ut when stress is to be laid, not on the state of mind
,. roduced, but on aspeeial object actually forgotten or remem-
iered, then this object is conceived as acted on directly, and its
noun is put iu the accusative: as„ omnia que memini, ‘every
fact which l remember ;¹ oblr'viscor causam, ‘I forget lthe (parti-
cular) ease ;’ recordor vocem, ‘ 1 call to mind the voice' In fact,
recordor is almost always followed by the accusative ; for it sug-
gests the idea of motion 3 ‘l bring into my mind again?

· 4. Obstabat.] ‘Stood before the deed, so as to screen it ;’
‘was a set-off against the deed'

5. Ad vulgus] After ingratus we generally find the dative
(XII. 9). Veneriingrataestruperbeb. Venusisactedonindirectly,
< being unpleasantly affected, by pride In the text, therefore,
ad vulgus should be taken rather with yudr'di : ‘a judgment in
theleyes of the people (when brought before the people)
unp easmg.

ὁ. Αιιοτοῐ.] Auges means ‘malie to grow.’ Auctor, therefore,
is ‘one who makes to grow’ (as rec-tor, ‘one who rules ;' ara-tor,
‘one who ploughs’); that is, ‘one who has anything to do with
bringing about or furthering a thing from its beginning to its
end ε’ hence, ‘founder,' ‘author‚' doer,’ ‘promoter,’ .‘ seconder.' ⁴
Here the word seems to be ‘author :’ though perhaps the sense
is best given by the phrase, ‘responsible for.’

‘Anthou' of course, comes from auctor: and from augeo, too,
comes auctumnus, ‘autumn'—the time for gathering in the
grmutlr of the year. Of our names for the four seasons, ‘autumn’

¹ is the only one derived from the Latin3 and, as such, is least
used 3 the Saxon word ‘harvest’ being more common among
country people.

7. Horatia] “To try Horatius for treason.'’ Our phrase
differs from the Latin. Τὴε duumvirs sit as judges. What do
they sit as judges about? bring up, as it were, and pass in review
before them? The crime of treason. Therefore perduellio isin
the accusative. Who is affected by this? Horatius. Therefore
hisnoun is in the dative. ⁴

8. Perduellionem.] Duellum (from duo, ‘two’l means
originally ‘a light between two,’ ‘duel ;’ then, ‘a fight between
two sides ;’ that is, ‘war 5' in which general sense the modern
form bellum is used. From the old form, and the preposition
per, comes perduellis, ‘one who is at war,' ‘a public enemy ;’
with the special meaning, ‘an enemy to one's country,’ that is,
‘a traitor.' Perduellzb, therefore, means, Ferime against the state,'
‘treasonz’ a crium of which Horatius was thought guilty,
