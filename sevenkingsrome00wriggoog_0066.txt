c. Beside ‘as,’ and ‘h0w,’ ut also means ‘that’ or ‘in order
that’ (ΙΙ, 8); and ‘that' or ‘so that' (IV. 5). Both these

hungry :' that is: ‘he runs in order that he may be hunhry)

that he was hungry.'

19. Auum regem] “When the young men had saluted their
grandfather as king.'’ Saluto, like appello (Ι. 13), is one of those
verbs which denote an action that is not complete in itsels ;
two nouus being necessary to complete the idea. These nouns
are generally both in the same case: in the accusative, is the
construction is active; as Caium consulem creaverunt: in the
nominative, if the construction is passive; as Caius constal
creatus est. Cuiam is in the accusative, as naming the object acted
upon directly hythe creating3 and consulem, which perhaps,
logically‚ should be in no case at all, is attracted naturally into
the same caseus Caium ; for it names the same object, if not
in the same, at least not in different circumstances. So Caius
is in the nominative as subject-word to creatus est ; and consul is
attracted into the same case with it.

This explanation will hold sor sum when used as the copula,
and for ull copulative verbs, as fio, ‘become3' maneo, ‘remain ;’
mado, ‘turn out ε’ also for such verbs as facab, ‘make ;' praesto,
‘show 3’ dico, ‘call‚' δια, both active and passive3 in fact, for all
verbs denoting an action, that does not by itsels present a
' complete idea, and which may therefore be classed together as
‘incomplete verbs'

CHAPTER V.

1. Condendae.] Urbis is in the genitive, as naming the passive
possessor, or cause, os the desire. But, observe, it is not a city
by itsels that causes the desire, but the building os a city.
‘They were possessed by the desire os a city to be built ε’ that
is, ‘ol' building a city.¹ Compare this construction with iram
prada amhsce, ‘resentment at losing their booty' (IV. 12). But

observe the differencer Urbs condenda is ‘the building of a ,

{ibai rdm.‘lrft‘t.¹.¹t{ul{¹⁰nlt⁵¹rttti ddilhtufig'
os a city-in fact, the city being designated as built; for condita
is a perfect participle. In other respects, these two nouns, as
they may be called, are alike, and pass through their cases and

numbers regularly. Perhaps it would be well to conceive them
