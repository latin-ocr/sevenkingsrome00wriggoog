eune. xL111. ‘ 1²3

‘they went to Caere! Etruscos, in the accusative sor the same
reason as Coere; because the place or persons to which we go
were conceived by the Romans as acted on directly‚ as changed,
by our going to them3 and therefore their nouns were put in
the accusative. Only before Etruscos, as not being the name of
a town or small island, usage requires the preposition in, which
here means ‘among,’-·‘they went to the Etruscans so as to be
among them.’ But Gabar in the next line is the name of the
town, not the people, and therefore isin the accusative without
a preposition.
