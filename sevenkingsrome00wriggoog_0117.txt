through it to the outside,’ as the accusative inarks motion to

a place (XI. 9) ε furis means, ⁴ at the door outside,’ as the ablative
marks rest at a place (XV. 2).

5. Mirandum] See XIV. 11.

6. Quid rei.] See IX. 6.
7. Salubria.] “All was going on well.''

8. confidere] “She trusted that in a day or two they would
see him.” Observe that se is omitted before confidere; regem
before jubere in the next line. Ipsum, ‘the man himself,' ‘the
person of whom they were talking! Ipse is merely the logical
demonstrative is, with the enclitic pse added to give emphasis to
it. In old writers the is was declined‚ the pse remaining un·
declined‚ according to the custom of enclitics: as, eam-pse,
eopse, etz-pse. Ipse, like ii, may be used of all three persons ; as,
ego ipse, ‘1 myself 3’ tu ipse, ‘thou thyself ;' Caius ipse, ‘Caius
himself! Like other adjectives of the sort, it often passes into
a noun (XII. 5): but as such, it seldom names any but a third
person, and then only in opposition to some other object.

9. Audientem] Audiq, ‘hear,'is followed by the accusative ε
sor the object heard is conceived as acted on directly, being
brought as it were to the ears of the hearer. And when audeo
means ‘hearlren to‚' ‘obey,‘ it generally preserves this con-
struction, though it is occasionally found with the dative, the
object hearkened to being conceived as standing still and affected
by the obedience. But obedio (from ob aud audio), ‘hearken to‚'
‘obey,' and pareo, ‘obey,' are always followed by the dative,
just as in French obe'ir is »followed by the preposition d. And,
though audau, meaning “ hearken to‚' is generally followed by
the accusative, yet the participle audiens is followed by the
dative, and generally by this noun dicu ; ‘hearkening to the
word,' ‘obedient’ In the text, beside dz'cto, there is another
dative, Seruio ,· for Servius is affected by his word being heark·

, ened to.

Note the verbs obedio and pareo, ‘obey,' as among those which
are intransitive in Latin, but transitive in English. ’

ιο. Sede sedens] See XXVII. 4.

11. Fungendae.] Fungar, being usually followed hy the
ablative (XXI. 20), is usually an intransitive verb (XIX. 17):
and, as such, has no passive participle jungendus, just as there
is no moriendus from auarior. But jungor is occasionally fol·
lowed by the accusative; and, being so far transitive, has the
participle fungendus, ‘to be discharged,⁷ just as miror, ‘admire,'
has mirandus, ‘to be admired’ So potior, which is usually
intransitive (V. 7), is occasionally transitive ; and hence we find

the passive participle indus: as spes potiundorum castrorum ,J
