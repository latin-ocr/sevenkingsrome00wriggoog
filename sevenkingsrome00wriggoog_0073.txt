64 nores. ἵ

It means ‘each,' ‘every ;‘ and is often placed after superlatives
and ordinal numerals: as, optimus purique, ‘all the best men ;‘
decimus quisque, ‘every tenth man.

b. In the text the plural is used, because Livy does not mean
‘all the nearest persons' ponimus quaquam but ‘all the
nearest peoples' or ‘states each state fumishing a number.
This distinction of number must be carefully remembered.
Similarly we have, ’

Sing. Alter, ‘one of the two persons!

Plur. Alteri, ‘one of the two parties,' ‘classes,'&c. (XXI. 26).

sing. Uter, ‘which of the two persons!

Plur. (Bri, ‘which of the two parties,’ ‘classes' &c (XIX.
16), And the same with mter, ‘neither of the two3’ and
uterque, ‘both of the two!

12. Liberis] a. Some nouns in Latin are used onlyin the
plural number: as liberi, ‘children; ' majores, ‘aucestors3' superi,
inferi, penates, manes, &c These name more objects than one;
and are, therefore, quite regularly in the plural. The singular
is wanting, because the single object was not regarded A man
was regarded as having, not a child, but children, a family: not

an ancester, but ancestors, ancestry. Hence we find, not lucr, ¹

‘child' but only lueri: not major, ‘anceston’ but only majores.
Most words of this sort have passed from adjectives into uouns:

as mergeres, ‘elder (men).'

b. eside the above, which name more objeets than one, there
are some nouns found only in the plural, which name a single
object: as arma, ‘armour3’ fides, ‘lyre;' castra, ‘camp’ In
these, therefore, there is something irregular. The explanation
seems to be that this single object was viewed and named with
reference to its constituent parts. The lyre was called by a
plural noun fides (G. fidelem), because it was an instrument com·
pounded of several strings. A suit of armour was called arma
(G. armorum), as com unded of several pieces. But a single
string was not called or fidis (sing.); nor was a single piece
of annour called annum. Remember, then, that of plural-only
nouns, some name more objects than one, as liberi ‚· some name

a single object, as castra.
13. Ea] “Thereto.” See XXI. 9.

14. Composito] The perfect assive participle in the neuter
gender often becomes a noun. hus here we have composr'tum,
‘arrangement' from componere, ‘arrange τ’ and at the end of

this chapter factum, ‘deed' from facab, ‘do' This follows ¹

naturally from the power a Latin adjective has of designating

sex by passi through genders In the neuter gender it
designates albing so clearly, that no neuter noun need be

attached ; just as inthe masculine gender it designates a man r
so clearly, that no masculine noun need be attached. Thus ¹
