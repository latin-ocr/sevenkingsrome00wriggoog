9. Migratum est.) Migro is an intransitive verb, andis there·
fore used impersonally in the passive: that is, only in the third
person, and without a subject-word. This passive construction,
instead of the active, is very common in Latin3 especially when
the writer does not care to state precisely who performs the
action. If the active migraverunt were used, it would be neces·
sary to insert a subjectword: but after migratum est it is not
necessary to name the persons by whom the migrations were
made. We cannot translate this construction literally3 ‘it was
migrated’ not being an English phrase Moreover, it is not tlre
exact translation, as there is nothing corresponding to ‘it' in
the Latin. Captum est only means ‘it was taken,’ when some
neuter noun has just been used, and may be understood. But
thisis not the case with migratum est. If we keep the passive
construction, we must adopt some such translation as the above
—‘ Frequent migrations were made.¹ See H. VIII. 23.

CHAPTER X.

1. Praeerat] ‘⁶ AllTverbs compounded of sunt, except possum,
are followed by a dative; for they each denote an action in
which an object is concerned, not an action by which an object
is moved.’' H. p. 142. Prae-sum means literally ‘am before,’ ‘am
in front 0f3’ hence, ‘preside over‚' ‘superintend’ See III. 4

2. Accipiat] See IX. 3for the tense.

a Sacris petitum] Sacris is in the dative after petitum,
because the sacrifice is concerned in having water brought to it.
For the supine, see XIX. 14.

4 Accepti obrutam] Notice this use of the participle iu
Latin. The sentence may be translated literally: ‘Having been
admitted, they killed her, having been overwhelmed with shields’
But we should say, ‘Having been admitted, they lrilled her by
overwhelming her with shields.’ The participle, therefore,
may be used. to denote the manner· in which, or the cause for
which, an acti0u is performed How did they kill her? By over·
whelming her with shields. And as the overwhelming pre-r
ceded the actual lrilling, we have the tense of obrutam agreeing
with what was said in Note IX. 1, b.

5. Magni ponderis] Notice this genitive, and compare it
with the ablative nragna saccis in the next line.

6. Brachia] ln the ablative, as naming the place on which
they wore the bracelets. The preposition in may be prefixed,
as in manibus, just below. See XXVII. 4·
