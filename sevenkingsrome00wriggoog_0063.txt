stating) mood, invenit, just as we have in English the in-
dicative ‘found' But in Latin the subjunctive takes wider
range. A verb is put in the subjunctive, when the action
denoted by it is spoken of as in any way subjoined to, or
dependent on, the main action. Now, in the text, the findingis
not stated by itself, but is made to depend on the suckling.
The dependence indeed is merely verbal It would be quite

mood But inasmuch as there is this verbal dependence, the
verb is put in the subjunctive. Thus, from the primary use of
the subjunctive moed, where the dependence is real as well as
verbal, comes the secondary use, where the dependence is not
real, but only verbal. The same conjunction ut is employed
to subjoin the dependent verb to the main verb in both uses.
In the former, ut means ‘in order that,' and subjoins the purpose,
which is dependent both verbally and really. In the latter, ut
means ‘so that,’ and subjoins the malt, which is dependent
verbally, but not really. ·

9. venando] This is the gerund in do, as it is sometimes
called, or the ablative case of the verbal noun venandum,
‘hunting' The nominative, however, as venandum, is so rarely
found, that perhaps it is better to consider the gerunds as
forming the noun in conjunction with the infinitive mood; as
