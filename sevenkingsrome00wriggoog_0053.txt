this is done, some slight difference of meaning may be intended.
Thus in the text we may translate: ‘whose betrothed Lavinia
bad been before the arrival of AEneas 3’ which im lies, notonly
that the betrothal had taken place (pacta erut) betlire the arrival

of AEneas‚ but that she had lived for some time aa the betrothed =
of Turnus before that event. So arma quoefixc in pamktz'lms ³
fuerant means, not ‘the arms which had been fixed to the walls,’ ¹

but ‘which had remained fixed or hanging on the walls.r Iu
fact, the participle witherum denotes an action, with fueram a
condition, the result of an action.

4 Praelatum.] “Indignant at a stranger being preferred to
him ;’' that is, ‘to himself' The imperfect pronoun sici names
the subject of the sentence, if a third personia subordinate*
circumstances. If the subject of the sentence is the first or
second person, it is named in subordinate circumstances by the
subordinate cases of ego or tu: as, ego cado me, ‘I strike myself3’
tu cadis te, ‘you strike yourself3’ Caius 'cadit se, ‘Caius strikes
himself) Since then sui only names the subject of the sentence
when in subordinate circumstances, but never as the subject, it
follows that it has no nominative case. It is commonly called
the Reflexive pronoun, because it refers, or is rfflcctel back for
its meaning, to the subject of the sentence. (H. Vlll. 31.)

5. Intulit] Our law for the dative is: ‘If an object is spoken
of as acted on indirectly, its noun is in the dative case. By
‘acted on indirectly' we mean, not moved or changed, but
‘affected by’ or ‘concerned in' the action.

a. Now, of transitive verbs, some denote au action which
seems to pass on to one object only, as ‘kill,’ ‘eat ς’ andsuch

verbs will be followed by one 'noun only, which, in Latin, will 1
be in the accusative case. But others denote an action which 1

passes on obviously to two objects: to one directly, so as to
move or change it; to the other indirectly, so as to affcct or
influence it ς and such verbs will be followed by two nouus,
one in the accusative, and the other in the dative case. If I
say, ‘Caius gives a book to the boy,' I say that Caius perforrns
an action which passes on to two objects: to the object ‘book'
directly, for he moves it from himself to the boy3 to the object
‘boy' indirectly, for the boy, without bein moved, is clearly
affected by or concemed in the action. In tin, therefore, the
verb will be followed by two nouns: by the noun naming
‘book' in the accusative; by the noun naming ‘boy' in the
dative: as, Caius dat libmm puero. Thus in the text, Turnus
