100 NOTES.

Romans3 so he does not say iste: but by some third persons,
the Albans; therefore he says ille, ‘Mettus yonder’ (XV. 1).

7. ln animo est] The subject-word to est is traducere:
‘Transporting to Rome is in my mind’

. 8. Redeat] Though redeat is in the subjunctive, there·is no

word in the sentence to which it can he subjoined. But this is
’ avery common Latin usage. From such expressions as rino,
volo, or impero ut redeat, the verb denoting permission, will, or
order, with the conjunction, cameto be omitted, leaving the
verb in the subjunctive alone to mean the same as the whole
phrase had previously meant. Thus redeat here means, ‘I will
that it retum,’ ‘let it retum3’ as if it were subjoined to some
such verb asuelo omitted. But it must not be supposed that
the speaker himself understands any omitted word. The present
subjunctive, either in the second or third person, has come to
have this sense quite by itself.

CHAPTER XXV.

1. Adaequant.] “revel with the ground.'’ Tecta is in the
accusative, because the houses were moved hythe action. Solo
is in the dative, because the ground was affected by the action,
beingythereby strewed with the houses.

2. Quibus] The time during which an action is being per·
formed has sometimes its noun in the ablative case, as in the
text : but much more commonly iu the accusative ; as, Romulus
septem et triginta regnavit annos. (XVII.)

3. Temperatum.] “ The temples of the gods were spared,”—
‘mercy was shown to, &c’

a. sempera (connected with tempus, ‘portion of time,' and ,

templum, ‘portion of space’ (V. 3) ; both words coming from the
same root, tem, ‘cut offl’) is primarily a transitive verb, meaning
‘apportion ;’ then, ‘check,’ ‘rule‚’ ‘tame ;’ in which sense it is
followed by the accusative3 as, Jupiter res leontinum torperet.
But it is also used intransitively to mean ‘preserve due propor-
tion,' ‘exercise control ς’ when it is followed hythe dative; as,
tempera liuguae, ‘preserve control over your tongue' Tben it
means ‘forbear,’ ‘abstain ;’ when the noun after it is in the
ablative, with or without ab, as specifying the object from which
one ahstains; as, imperat α lacrymis, terrrperat risu. Lastly, it
means, ‘exercise control over myself’ Now, when 1 am said to
exercise control over myself with regard to an object, it gene·
rally means that 1 show mercy to that object, that l spate it.
Thus tenrprro comes to mean ‘spara’ as in the text; in which
sense the object spared has its noun in the dative, as it is acted
