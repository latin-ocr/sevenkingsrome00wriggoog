the object that gets in my way.

4 nercule] Ferculum is used here in its pn'mary sense, ‘a
frame to carry anything on‚' from fero, ‘carry’ Generally it is
used in a special sense, meaning not ‘the frame that carries,'
but ‘the object carried-up to table τ’ that is, ‘a dish‚’ ‘a
course! There is also a wo'rd feretrum, haring the same primary
meaning, but usually naming the obJ'ect which we call ‘bien’

which it is always used.

7. Jupiter] The name by which nbis god was called, before
any terminations for making cases were affired, was Jbv. In
speaking of him as the subject of the sentence, and in addressing
