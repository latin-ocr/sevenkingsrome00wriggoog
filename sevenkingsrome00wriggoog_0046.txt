INTRODUCTORY.

THE following remarks, taken from my “Help to Latin
Grammar‚'' will serve to explain certain terms which are used
in the Notes, and to give some idea of the general principles on
which the Notes are constructed. If not suited to the pupil at
fihrst staplting, they may be explained to him at the discretion of
t eteac er.

1. A Noun is the name of an object ; that is, of anything
lhl'fild pe can see, hear, taste, touch, smell, or in any way

[The word ‘object’ is used by grammarians in two senses· vIu
both it means ‘a thing laid before,' being derived from ob·
jectum, the perfect passive participle of the verb objthm, ‘lay
before.³ The difference of meaning results from a different
word being understood after obs'ectum.

a. If we understand menti, object means ‘anything whatever
laid before the mind ς’ that is, anything whatever that we can
perceive with the senses, or in any way think of. Itis in this
sense that a noun may be defined as the name of an object;
and in this sense* only is the word ‘object’ used in the
following pages.

b. If we understand oritoni aster objectum, object means
‘that which is laid before and exposed to the action denoted by
averb' Ihave not used the word in this sense, both for fear
of confusing it with the former sense, and because it does not
appear to me to convey a strictly accurate idea]

2. Cases are, Certain forms which the noun passes through,
in order to show the circumstances in which the object, named
by the noun, is placed.

The circumstances in which an object may be placed are very

⁴ We mi ht use in this sense, if we took its original and proper meaning,
the English word ‘thin .' For the noun ‘thing’ ‚is connected with the
¹ verb ⁴ thmk‚’ as res is with reor in Latin, and ding with denken in German:
and means, as those words do, ‘an hing whatever thought of ς’ which is
the exact meaning v've attach to t e word ‘object’ But as, in common
language, we call inanimate objects ‘things’ in opposition to animate
objects or persons, we can hardly use the word ‘thing' in this general sense,
but must use instead the Latin word ‘obJect'
