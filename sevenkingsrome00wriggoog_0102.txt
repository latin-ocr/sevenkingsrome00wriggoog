19. Defungi.] Fungar is one of those transitive deponents
which we spoke of (V. 7) as followed by the ablative case. Its
ordinary meaning is ‘discharge’ ‘execute,' ‘do ;' as, firngz'tur
o ¹, ‘he discharges his duty) The accusative might, there·
ore, be expected aiter it; but the ablative seems owin to the
origin of the word. It probably comes from fugia,‘ ee ;' its
first meaning being ‘escape srom,' ‘get rid of. The object,
then, from which one escapes would naturally have its noun in
the ablative (III. 6). Itis, however, never used in the sense ol
shirlring3 it only means, ‘get rid os by discharging,’ as we get
rid of a duty by discharging it. The compound dcfirngor is
used in the same sense. Defugere praelium is ‘to shirk the
battle ;' defungi proelz'rr, ‘to light the battle out’

20. Alter.] Alter here is the third Curiatius, hut the second
ot' the survivors ; ‘who neither was sar oux ‘who, like his brother,
(the quein nec), was at no great distance' Alterum, just helon,
is the second elain.

21. Singuli] “One on each side.'’

22. Duos] Dua is also in use sor the accusative. So both
ambos aud ambo are allowable. ,

23. Sustinenti.] Sustinenti agrees with Curz'nn‘o omitted,
which is in the dative aster dfigit. ‘He drives his sword into
Curiatius) The sword is moved; therefore gladium isin the
accusative. Curiatius is not moved, but is affected, hythe driv-
ing3 therefore Cunhtio is in the dative. And so I think is
jugula and for the same reason ; Curiatio naming the whole
person thus affected, aud then jugulo naming the part of him
specially affected. This double dative, if it is one, bears no
resemblance to that spoken of in Note 1'0, but is like his-animo,
in Note .

Juguld, however, may be in the ablative, as naming the
place in which the sword was driven. But, if it were, we should
ratheIr expect the preposition in: as, cultrum in corde dqtgz't
(XL. 12).

24. Eo-quo.] When ea means ‘thithen’ ‘to that point,' itis
probably the old accusative e-om, from is (9). But eo is also the
ablative neuter; and, as such, has three meanings.

a. ‘There' ‘at that place) This is arare use, but one allowed
by the idea os the ablative (XV. 2).

b. ‘By that,' ‘by so much) In this sense it is used only
with comparatives. We may say, majarpede, ‘taller by a foot ;’
