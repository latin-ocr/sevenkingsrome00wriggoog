15. Taceri] This verb shows how indistiuct tlte boundary
line between transitive and intransitive verbs often is. Taceo
means ‘am silent’ ‘say not a word :' a sense clearly intransitive;
for not only does not the action seem to pass on to another
object, but at first sIght there seems to be no action at all.
Accordingly, we have no verb in English answering to taxeo.
But to the Romans every quality appeared more or less active.
ln Latin, therefore, every quality might be denoted by a verb.
Thus they saw in being silent a ce'rtain activity, the activity
perhaps of abstaining from noise; and so the'y put taceo through
rts tenses—first as an intransitive verb. But, if aman is silent,
he may be silent about a certain object: and on this object he
may be conceived to act directly ; for he passes it by or neglects
it; he changes it from anotioed toan unnoticed object Thus
taceo slides into atransitive verb, and is followed by a noun in
the accusative: as, conrmrlrsa tacere, ‘to keep secrets ;' ut ulios
taceam, ‘to pass over others in silence) And therefore, like
any other transitive verb, it passes through the passive form, as
in the text. So, tacetur amor, ‘love is passed by in silence3’
tacenda locutus, ‘saying things that should not be said’ Siler,
too, becomes transitive in the same way.

18. Scilicet] Sci-licet means literally, ‘one may know;’
¹ st as vide-licet means, ‘one may see; i-licer, ‘one may go.’

enee scilicet means ‘of course,’ ‘to be sure,' ‘forsooth;' often
in an ironical sense, but often in a merely explanatory sense, as
in the text. ‘He kissed the earth, because you must know he
regarded heras the common mother of all living)

CHAPTER xl.

1. Ut in ea] “A nation, for that country and that time.'’
Ut is frequently used in this limiting sense: ‘a nation very
wealthy, not indeed for our times, but as being in that age—as
would be regarded in that age.’ Compare multe azam, ut in
homine Romano, literae ,¹ ‘fora Roman too, a well-lettered man)

(Cic. Sen. 12.)

2. anue ipsa] “And that very wealth was the cause of

the war, because the Roman king was anxious, not only to
enrich himself, but also,'' &c
