ι text, ‘AEneas called both nations‘Latins, that he might con·

ciliate,’ &c The conciliating is spoken of notas actual y taking
place, but as a purpose conceived by AEneas. Livy does not say
that AEneas did conciliate, but that his purpose was to con·
ciliate. The first, then, and simplest use of the subjunctive
is when the suhjoined action is spoken of, not as a fact that
actually takes place, but as a notion conceived in the mind.

The conjunction ut, which joins conciliaret to appellavit, is used
in 'various senses. Here it means ‘that' ‘in order that3' end
as it is followed by the subjunctive meod, must be considered
a snbjoining conjunction. The conjunction nr, ‘lest' ‘that
not,' which joins essent to appellavit, is also a subjoining con-
junction. For the tense of conciliaret and essct, sce Ι. 12.

9. Nec deinde] “Nor after that did the natives yield to
the Trojans in affection and fidelity towards king AEneas: and
relying on these dispositions of the two daily coalescing nations,
although Etruria was so great in power, that by this time it
had filled, not lands only, hut also the sea, through the whole
length of Italy, from the Alps to the Sicilian Straits‚ with the
fame of its neme, et AEneaS, when he might. have warded off
the war behind walls, led forth his forces to battle'’

so. Studio] Our law for the ablative isc ‘lf an object is ³

spoken of ss subsidisry to the action of the subject, its noun is
in the ablative case' By ‘subsidiary' we mean ‘accompanying‚'
not on equal terms, but so as to explain or tell something more
about the action. r

a. It is clear that many and very different objects may be ’
spoken of as explaining or telling something more about the
action. “If Ι were to say, ‘The man gave the hook to the boy,'
1 might be asked‚ ‘Where did he give it? when did he give it?
why or how did he give it? what did he give it with?’ and so
on. And 1 might answer, ‘A't Carthage3 in the morning3 ont
of love; in a certain manner 3 ¹with his hand‚’ &c Now these
different ohJects Carthage, Moming Love, Menner, Hand. dcc„
are all spoken of, not as in any way affected by the action of the
man, but as subsidiary to, or tellrng something more about it;
and, therefore, their nouus are all alike in the ablative case.”
(H, VII. 22.) It follows therefore that, under the general class
of nouns in the ablative‚ as naming subsidtory objects, we shall
have several special classes3 such as nouns in the ablative‚ as
naming ploce, time, cause, manner, instrum, &c

b. The nouns oudo and fide in the text do not seem to fall
under any of these special classes; butthey may be said to
belong to another class, and to be in the spea'sjting ablative‚ for
they specil} that in which the natives did notyield to the
Trojans. pecifying ablatives will, of course, ber uired with
verbs (or adjectives), which den'ote a vague or genere aetion (or
