preposition cum is repeated with the ablative ; as, conserte hanc
pacem cum illo bello, ‘compare' this peace with that war 3' the
peace and the war being set together.

r CHAPTER XXXII.

1. Pro indignissima] “Who had always held it very un-
fair that they should be driven from their father's throne.’' The
preposition pro means primarily-

a. ‘Before’ ‘in front of ι’ as, consederant pro castris duo exer-
citus XXI.

b. ⁹ ⁴ In defence of‚’ ‘for the sake of ;' for 1 may put an object
before me, to stand iu my descnce: as, ut pro sua patria dimi-
cent XX. 1.

α’ ‘In place of 3’ for 1 may step back, and put an object
before me, to stand in my place, as my substitute: as, quum pro
cosrsule in Ciliciam prcyfcs'scens Athenas venissem (Cic. de Orat.
I. 82.) Hence aII such words as proconsul, propretor, dcc. And
from this notion of one object beIng in place of another come
all such meanings as— · .

‘Equivalent to‚' ‘as good as‚' ‘as’ ‘for τ’ aspro indsgnissr'rm
in the text. So, pro cerro habeo, ‘I hold as certain ι’ hunc amavi
pro meo, ‘this lad I loved as my own son τ’ pro mortuo est, ‘heis
as good as dead' Also such meanings as-

‘In payment 0f‚' ‘in consideration of‚' ‘on account of :' as,
pro vectura solvere, ‘to pay for the carriage ;' repro tua eximia
suavitate amo, ‘I love you for your sweetness.’

d. ‘In comparison of,’ ‘in proportior to ; ' for I may put an
object before me, on purpose that it may be compared with me :
ιε, pro ardore. See VIII. 1.

2. Averteret.] The preposition a implies ‘away from the
other.’ Compare XXVI. 5.

3. Stamina] Notice this word as preferring the accusative
in im instead of em. See IV. 3.

4 Foras ejiciunt] Τὴε Latin for ‘I turned the boy out of
doors' fs, puerum serras ejeci .· for ‘the boy remainsout of doors,'
prser foris sacratur. That is, the adverb soros implies motion
from the inside to the outside: the adverb fhris Implies rest
outside. This difference may be explained by reference to the
origin of the two words. boras, G. faerrsis, is the Latin word in
use for ‘door :' but there must have beeh an old word fora,
G. soroe, of which firras was the accusative, and soris the
ablative plural. Foras, therefore, means ‘to the door and
