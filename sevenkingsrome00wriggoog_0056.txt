11. Cernere] Cedo is an intransitive verb, meaning, origi· v
nally, ‘move quietly,’ ‘walle' It then means ‘go away,' ‘with-
draw’ Nowis Igo away, not exacti from a erson, hut so as
to let him step into the place which vacate, iact on him in·
directly ; for he is concerned in my going away. Hence cedo
comesto mean, ‘give place,' ‘yield,’ ‘submit 3' and is followed
by a noun in the ‚dative case: as, Viriatho exercitus nostri
cesseram, ‘our armies submitted to Viriathus ;' and in the text,
‘the natives yielded to the Trojans.' And still further: from
the notion¹ of gi 'place or'yielding generally comes the
inititil'ttitiltwwetti {tinterniae
verb, and is followedby two nouus ; one in the accusative, and ’
the other in the dative, like do, infero, &c (5); as, Caius fratri
curram cessit, ‘Caius gave up the chariot to his brother! This,
however, is not a very common use oi the word.

12. Prema] “ Relying on.'' Fretus probably comes from fero,

‘bean' being changed by metathesis (transposition os letters)
from fertus. Fero as no participle of its own in use, having
recourse, instead, to latus, which comes from a different root.
But ser-tur would corne naturally from fer-0, like ser-tus from
ser-o, ‘twine,’ and partus from por-rh, ‘produce’ Also the
change os letters is not uncommon ; as in spretus from sper-no,
‘despise‚’ and stra-tus from ster-no, ‘strew' So from cer-no,
‘sita’ come both cer-tus and cre-tus. Fretus, therefore, means,
literally, ‘borne up ;' and hence we see why it should be fol·
lowed, as it almost always is, bya noun in the ablative case.
The object ou which we rely is the object by which we are
borne up3 that is, the cause or instrument, which is clearly a
subsidiary object Otherwise we might have expected the
dative 3 which, indeed, is occasionally found.

13. In dien] Originally the phrase ran, Mean crant de da
in diem or better, de diebus in dies ; sor the disease increases‚
not only from Monday to Weduesday, but from Tuesday to
ssursday. Asterwards de diebus carne to be left out3 and there
remaius in common use in dies, sometimes written indies, as an
adverb, and meaning ‘daily’ Quotidie (from quot diss, ‘as many
days as there are’) also means ‘daily.' But otidis is used
when we wish to express merely the repetition o an action ε as,
prandeo quotidie, ‘I dine daily.’ In dt'es is used when we wish
to speak os an action being repeated with progressive increase
or decrease, asin the text.

14 AEneas.] In the whole sentence AEneas is the main
subject-word; attached to which, as an adjective, are the words
