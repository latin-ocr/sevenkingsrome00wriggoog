cunr. 11. 45

Latino bellum intulit ,· ‘Turnus brought war on Latinus’ Bellum
is in the accusative, as naming the object moved by Turnus.
Latino is in the dative, as naming the object, not moved, but
affected by the bringing.. Latinus stands still, and receives the
war. Compare arma Rutulis iunxa't, and animos sibi conciliaret,
a little below.

b. Os course, if the 'sentence is tumed into one with a passive
construction, the construction of the dative is not altered. A ’
Turno bellum Latino illatum est; ‘war was brought on Latinus
by Tumus.’ Bellum is in the nominative instead os the accusa·
tive; sor now it names the subject of the sentence. But Latino
remains in tie dative; for Latinus is acted on exactly in the
same way, whether we speak of Turnus bringing the war, or os
the war being brought by Turnus. Either way, Latinus stands
still and receives the war. Thus you have above, cui pocta Lo·

, vinrofuerat‚and prolatum sibi advenam. (See H. Vn. 15, dic.)

6. Victi] “ Were conquered.'’ The participle is both in use
and form an adjective. The passive participle victi, joined to
the noun Rutuli, denotes that the people named Rutulians
possessed the quality of being ‘ conquered' just as boni would
denote that they possessed the quality os being ‘good' And
with neither word is it necessary to add the copularunt: for
the mere fact of placing a word, denoting quality, by the side
oi a noun, can only imply that the object, named by the noun,
possesses that quality. In English, however, usage requires ns
to insert the copula: as, ‘The Rutuliaus were conquered.' And
in Latin the copula must be inserted, when we wish to denote
the time at, or the mode in, which an action is performed.
Thus there is no copula with petiti (1), because nothing more is
denoted than the fact of the Trojans being attached. Aridior
the same reason there is no need of esse with prelatum (4). But

¹ fuerat (or erat) is necessary with pacta (3), because Livy wished
to speak of the betrothing, not only as accomplished‚ but as
accomplished before the performauce of the action denoted by ,
the main verb intulit. ’

7. Rutulis] Perhaps in strict accuracy it should be, armis
Rutulorum. But this is a mode of writing not nncommon in
Latin. Compare, Ingenio nostrorum hominum multum ceteris
hominibus prestiterunt (instead os ceterorum hominum ingeniis).
Cic. de Orat. I. 4.

8. Conciliaret.] This is the first aud simplest use os the sub·
junctive. Scribo atteias, ‘Iwrite that you may know.’ Istate
as a fact that Iwrite‚ and therefore scribo is in the indicative
or stating mood. But Ι do not state as a fact that you know.
1 merely mention it as the purpose sor which I write. Your
knowin is subjoined to my wnting, notas a fact that actually

takes p ce, but asa notion conceived in my mind. So in the
