tion, and as such is followed by the subjunctive mood. Now
the fact subjoined by quum may be connected with the main
fact in several ways. It may be subjoined as a reason for or
against the main sact. When quum subjoins a fact as a reason
for the main ¹fact, it may be translated ‘since' though the notion
of time is not altogether lost3 as, qua quum ita rint, prgtciscar,
‘now'that these things are so, l will set out ;' or, ‘since now
these things are so ;' or simply, ‘since this is the case'

c. Again, when quum subjoins afact as a reason against the
main fact, it ma be translated ‘though' as in the text. ‘When
AEneas was able to stay behind walls, he did not do s0, as
might be expected, but marehed out ;' or, ‘though at the time
he was, able ς’ or, as we should say, ‘though he might have
stayed.

place being regarded as situated there. And it very osten has
that special sense of ‘situated’ which it has here; viz. ‘situated
in the gravess ‘lying buried.’ There is also from the same verb
the noun situs, ‘situation' ‘site’ (Ill. 2).

21. Indigetem] “The Latins call him Jupiter Indiges;’' ,
or, ‘Jupiter bomin our land’ Indiges (from indu, an old torm
of in, and gen, the root of gigno, gen-ui) means literally ‘born
in:' and Deus indiges is the ordinary name for a ‘national

2. Quae ab situ] “Which from the situation ot the town
stretched on the “die“ the hill was called Lpnga Alba ε ” or,
‘Long Whrte Town, hke our ‘Long Whrtton.

3. Mansit Silviis] “The sumame oi Silvius was after that
retained by all who reigned at Alba.'' The Latinior ‘my name

apposition with nomn, as Ι. 15: or, more commonly, as in the
text, nomen milri est Silana,¹ Silvia being in apposition with
milri ,² for it is as correct to say, ‘I am Silvius,' as ‘my name is
Silvius τ’ or, occasionally, but not well, nomen mihi est Silvii,·
