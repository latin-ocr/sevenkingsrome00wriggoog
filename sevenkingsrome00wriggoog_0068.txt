cunr. v. 59

Birds, when supplying signs by their voice, were called oscines
(from os and cano); by their ssight, properes [literally ‘goers·
forward‚' from prce and peto). lt was by means of the latter
that the brothers proposed to ascertain the will of the gods.
With this purpose they each marked out a certain portion 'of
the sky, called templum (from the root tem, ‘cut off '), in which
they were to make their observati0n; and also a certain spot of
ground, likewise called templum, from which they were to make
their observation. Remus, from his ternplum on the Aventine,
first sees six vultures cross his templum in the sky. His com·
panions immediately hail him king. But no sooner is this
hetthim? &simitudinem itini?
Whereupon he, too, is saluted king by his friends. But which is
to be king? Do the gods declare their will by priority of time
or superiority of number? This beinga moot point, they settled
it by the sword.

4. Vulgatior.] Participles, like other adjectives, admit of
degrees of compariscn, when the action denoted by them
admits of the notion of comparison. We cannot think of
one man being more killed than another; therefore there is no
comparative interfectior. But we can think of one story being
more noised abroad than another; therefore there is the com-
parativevulgatzbr.

5. Fama est] As verbs of saying, perceiving, dra, are fol·
lowed by the accusative and infinitive (H. VIII. 14), so also are
nouns which name the actions denoted by such verbs. Thus, in
the text, the noun Jizma, ‘talk,’ ‘saying,' which names the action
denoted by the verb satur, ‘says,’ or datr, ‘tells’ is followed by
the accusative and infinitive, or two accusatives, Remum and
transmisse. There is a talk of-whom? Remus. What? His
leaping over the walls. Therefore the object ‘Remus' and the
object ‘leaping·over,’ being both conceived as moved from the
mouth of the speaker to the ears of the hearer, have their nouns
in the accusative case,

6. Ludibrio fratria] This is an expression in which it
would be somewhat far-fetched, though not perhaps altogether
incorrect, to say that fratris is in the genitive, as naming the
cause of the mockery. But it is both correct and simple to say
that fratris is in the genitive, as naming the passive possessor of
the mockery. The brother does not display mockery, but has
mockery displayed toward him.

¹ 7. Potitus] As the deponent potior has the transitive signi-
fication ‘acquire’ ‘obtain' the accusative might be expected
after it, aud is occasionally found, as in Lucretius, Homerus
sceptra potitur. But it is usually followedby the ablative case.
