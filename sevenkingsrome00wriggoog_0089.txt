6. Quibus] In the ablative as naming the cause (IX. 7).

7. convalescit] a. When there are more subject-words than
one, the rule is for the verb to be in the plural number, because
it tells something about more than one object (H. VIII. 2). And
this rule generally holds when the subject-words name concrete*

agreeing with that subject-word on which the writer wishes to
lay stress, and which, therefore, he planes nearest the verb.
