10. A Pronoun isa word used instead os a noun.

There are in Latin only two perfect pronouns31eg0 sor the
first person, and tutor the second. There is also sor the third
person the imperfect pronoun sui.

As the use oi the noun and pronoun is the same, it must be
understood that, when we speak oi a noun generally, we include
under the term these three pronouns. The other words, some·
times called pronouns; such as liic, ille, dre. ; will be treated in
the Notes as adjectives, and may be called, by way of distinction,
pronominal adjectives.

11. An Adjective isa word, which, joined to a noun, denotet
that the object named by the noun possessas a certain quality.

The adjective passes through numbers and cases, like the
noun; and also through genders, which the noun does not.
The numbers, cases, and genders oi an adjective are, Certain
iorms which the adjective passes through, in order to suit the
number, case, and gender of the noun to which it is' joined

12. A Verb is a word, which, joined to anoun, denotee that
the obJect named by the noun persorms a certain action.

The verb passes through persons, numbers, tenses, and moods.
With regard to these, it is sufficient sor our present purpose to
observe, that, when it is simply stated that an object periorms
an action, the verb is put in the indicative (or statingj mood;
but when an action, whether spoken oi as actually taking place
or not, is conceived as in any way dependent on another action,
then the verb is put in the subjwncta've mood. Our aim, then, in ι
explaining verbs in the subjunctive, will be to show that the
action denoted by them is conceived as in some way or other
dependent on some other action; and we shall speak of such
verbs as subjoined to some other verb. But is thete isin a
sentence, beside the main verb, a verb iu the indicative mood,
then we shall s eak os such verbs as crrj'cimd to the' main verb 3
and shall consider that the action denoted by it is not conceived
as dependent on the action denoted by the main verb.

13. If a word is used to join together words or sentences, it is
mlled a Conjunction

Conjunctions may be classed as conjoinlng, adjoining, and
subjoiningconjuncttons. '

Conjoining conjunctions, as et ‘and,’ aut ‘0r,’ join together
words in the same sentence, and different sentences, on equal
terms.

Adjoinz'ng and subeining conjunctions are used to join on
secondary clauses to the main sentence And, just as we call
the verbs in these clauses adjoined or subjoined, according as
they are in the indicative or subjunctive mood; that is, accord-
