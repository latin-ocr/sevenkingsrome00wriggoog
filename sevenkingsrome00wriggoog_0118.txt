enin. xxxrv. 109

lVopl os taking the camp 3 ' literally ‘ol the camp to be taken,’
. 1.

12. Vlcis.] See XXI. 13.

· CHAPTER XXXIII.

1. Liberum] The genitive plural os the second declension
has occasionally this contracted form, especially in poetry. So
we find duum for duorum, deum sor deorum, virum sor virorum,
modium for vindictum, &o

2. Aggreditur.] After aggrediar (from ud and gradior),
‘walk to‚’ ‘approach' ‘undertake,’ the ad is repeated in the
best writers, as in the text. But, opus aggredior opimum casibus.
(Tac Hist. I. 2.) When it means ‘address‚' ‘accost,’ ‘attach’ it
is transitive, being followed by the accusative without ad.

3. Interlucet.] The clause quibus—interlucet is a mere ad*-
jectIve to ordinum, and is so completely independent of the
sentence, that the Indicative mood is preserved r though, as it
is a clause inserted in a subjoined clause, the subjunctive would
be more customary. Compare XXV. 7, and XXXVII. 9.

CHAPTER XXXIV.

1. Invidia regni] See III. 14. Here the passive possessor
may be regarded as the cause. i

2. DomestIcos.] ‘⁴ Members of his samily.'’ Domesticos is an
adjective, passed lnto a noun, like mei, sui, dic. (XII. 3, b).

3. Nupserant.] “The two daughters of Tullius had married
the two Tarquinii.”

4 Minos] See III. 10.
5. Pravae ambitionis] See X. 5.

6. Implet] impleo, like plenus, is followed both by the
ablative and genitive. See XXI. 1.

7. Intestior.] Iusenus means both ‘dangerous' (XIX. 3)
and tendangered ;' both ‘troublesome‚’ and ‘troubled’ Here
it seems to have the latter sense, as also at the beginning of the
chapter: ‘unquieb' ‘unsase' Via serpentibus infista means, ‘a
way made unsase by serpents ἐ hence our word ‘infested’

8. Parricidia] As parentes means, not only ‘parents' but
‘relations’ generally3 parricidium (stom parens and credo)
means ‘murder ol one’s relations‚' and not only of one's parents.
Compare the meaning of the word parent In French.
