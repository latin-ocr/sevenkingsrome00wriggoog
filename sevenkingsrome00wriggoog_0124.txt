CHAPTER XXXVIII.

1. Receptis.] The first meaning of recipio, as its composition
warrants‚ is, ‘take back,’ ‘get back‚’ ‘recover ;’ as, nunquam
ego Tarentum recepissem, m‘si tuperdtilr'sses (Cic. de Orat. ΙΙ. 273).
But here the meaning ol re seems quite lost (XXXVII. 2), and
receptis can only mean, ‘having been taken) Compare eo oppeto
recepto (Caes. VII. 13).

2. Usus est.] (lter is one of the deponents which are fol·
lowed by the ablative, though translated into English by trans-
itive verbs (V. 7); perhaps because the object which I use is
an instrument, and the instrument always has its noun ln the
ablative. The primary sense of utor seems» to be, ‘assist

'myself3' and this more clearly marks the object used as the

instrument with which I assrst myself. Uter is occasionally ·

followed by an accusative; and, being so far transitive, it
&xxpaslsilv'e participle in dus, utendus, like potor and firngor

3. Operis] Beside redes and litero (XXX. 3), there are a few
other nouns which have asomewhat different sense in the plural 3 .
as, auxilium, ‘help 3'auxilt'o, ‘auxiliary troops z ’ coptu, ‘plenty3'
copr‘ae, ‘forces :' opera, ‘work 3’ opera, ‘workmen ;' as in the
text: gratia, ‘favour ;'gratt'oe, ‘thanks’

4 Qui quum haud] “ And though this labour‚ in itself no
slight matter, was added to military⁴ service, yet the common
people were less indignant at rearing with their own hands
temples to the gods, than after that they were transferred to
other works‚ not only inferior in dignity, but also of consi-
derably greater toil ς viz. tu making rows of seats.'’ For ret-sie,

see XXI. 14

5. Feros] See XXVIII. 3. He finished the Circus Maximus
which his father had begun.

6. Sub terram] “To carrying underground.” Sub originally
means ‘up3' but as, ifI look up to an object, Iam under it,
sub means commonly, ‘unden’ It is followed by the ablative
when the verb does not denote motion 3 by the accusative, when
it does ε as, pomo jacent sub arbore, ‘apples lle under the tree ; '
pomo sub arborem jeci, ‘Ithrew apples under the tree’ Not
that there is anything in the word sub to govem either case.
Arbore is in the ablative, as naming the place at which (XV. 2) 3
arborem is in the accusative, as naming the placeto which
’ (XI. 9). *What sub does, isto distinguish further the circum-
stances denoted hythe cases of the noun (H. VIII. 20, sl: to

show, that the apples were notin (in), or iti front of (prr), the
