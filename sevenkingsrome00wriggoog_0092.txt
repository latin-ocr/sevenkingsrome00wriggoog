1. Dissimirie] Wehave seen (XII. 9) that adjectives, denot-
'llg-eltl³¹llr⁵’alhl⁰0¹h{llrl⁶ ⁰?lilll2h¹²⁰l?⁵r3f{llg dlllllln
mdy be’ followed by the nddns which rigdme those objects in thd
dative case. Hence the dative aster similis and dissimilis, adjec-
tives denoting similarity and the opposite. But the genitive
may also be used aster such adjectives3 and is inore frequently
used, when the noun names a person; as, filius similis patris,
‘the son is like his father.’ · 'This use of the genitive follows,
from the principle laid down VI. 5. Similitudo patrii means
‘likeness to the father3’ patrat being in the genitive, as naming
the passive possessor of the likeness. Hence adjectives corre-
sponding in meaning with melitum are sollowed hythe genitive ε
as, similis, dissimilis, dre. See also XV. 4.

2. Ferocior Romula] “More warlike even than Romulus. ''
y Ratus.] As usual, with a present signification. See IX. 1.

4 Sub idern] “About the same time.” Sub followed by
nouns naming time in the accusative case denotes approximation
towards; ‘immediately besore,' or ‘asten’ ‘about'

5. Repetendas.] “To demand restitution:” literally, ‘to
ask back the things which had been carried off)

6. Praeceperat.] “Tullus had ordered his envoys to do

, nothing before they had executed their commission.” For the

adjective sui as a noun, see XII. 3. For the subjunctive after
preceperat, see VII. 16. ’

7. socordius] The comparative form os the adjective is
sometimes used to denote that the quality is possessed, in a con-
siderable. or too high a degree: as, nisi sis natura tardum
‘unless you are somewhat slow by nature) So in the text, ‘By “
the Albans the business was transacted sornewhat sluggishly,’ or
carelessly. There is no positive adverb answering to socors ,¹ but
that want does not prevent the comparative neutersacordiur
being used adverbially.

Al} Priores] “Had first demanded:’' that is, before the ν
ans.

9. venerint] In the subjunctive, as in oratio obliqua (VII.
15); and in the perfect, to accord with the surm os the historical
