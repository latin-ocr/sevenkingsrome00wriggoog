6. Romana] “By thoroughlyun·Roman arts.'' See xxti,

7. nd ultimum] See XI. 5.

8. inscia] Here, again, the construction follows the adjec-
tive, as if it were a verb. Compare XXXVI. 2. .

9. Quibus esset] Compare this relative clause, inserted
in a subjoined clause, with the clause quibus-interlucet,
XXXIII. 3. Here the subjunctive is used, because the victory
of the Gabines was a matter closely connected with the fighting
of the battle. There the indicative is used, because the distinc-
tion created by ranke is a fact of general acceptation, true for all
time, and quite independent of the action denoted by the verb
. of the subjoined clause.

10. Caritate esee] See X. 5.

11. Satis virium] Satis is an indeclinable adjective; as,
satis cst nbi in legibus proeszdium, ‘you have sufficient 'protection

libro, ‘measure by pounds,' that is, ‘weigh' So we talk of
weighing the matter on which we deliberate.

13. Dixerit. Refert, being the historical present, is followed,
as its present orm warrants, by the perfect subjunctive: ‘he
. tells him what he has said! Or it mIght be followed, as its
past tense would warrant, by the pluperfect unisset: ‘he tells
him what he had said.'

14. Ingenio.] In the dative after ἐκπίω, the mind being

affected by the pride being Implented in it. ’ Or it might be in ,
’ the ablative, as naming the place iu which the pride Is implanted
