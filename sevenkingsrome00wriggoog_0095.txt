86ἑ ’ unumst-5²

'7. Quam proxime] Notic'e this construction for expressin'gj*
a quality in a very great degree. Caesar quam maximas potest
amaus curupurat, ‘Caesar gets together as large forces as he cam’
A combination‚ as it were, of the two constructions‚ Cesar
maximas comparat copias ; and, cuprius tam quom potest comparat:
‘Caesar gets together the largest forces, so as he can’ Possum
may be left out. We may say either. dicam quam brenissimc
possum, or dicam quam breuissime, for ⁴ 1 will speak as briefly as
Ican.' Qrmntus also iscombined with the superlative; as,
Hannibal quomam maximam uastitatem potest cudibus incendiu-
que ffcit, ‘the greatest possible devastation’

8. Inde legatum] “From that point he sends forward an
envoy, and ¹bids him tell Tullus that before fighting there was
need of a conference.'' opus means ‘work‚’ ‘business’ ‘need’
In the sense of ‘need,’ it is used with three cases. '

a. With the ablative; as, opus milri est aba, ‘there is need to
me of food‚’ ‘I want food ς’ literally, ‘there is business to me
with food ;’ cibo being in the ablative‚ as naming the specrfiul
object (ΙΙ. 10).

b. With the genitive, but not usually3 as, quanti cibi opus
mul? ‘Of how much food was there needi' culi being in the
genitive, as naming the passive possessor of the need. '

c. In apprnition; as, opus milri est culus, ‘food is a need to
me) But without change of number ; as, milites opus suut ubi,
‘soldiers.are o. need to you,’ ‘you want soldiers.’ Or in this
construction opus may be considered an indeclinahle adjective,
meaning ‘necessary' ·

9. Priusquam] Priusquam is followed by the subjunctive,
when the dependence on the main verb is rea13 that is, when
the subjoined action is not spoken of as really taking place: as
in the text, where, however, dimicent would be in the subjunc-
tive, as being in aratra obliqua. But when the dependence is
verbal; that is, when the adjoined action is spoken of as really
taking place, or as already commenced ; then priusquam isgene-
rally followed by the indicative3 as, priusquam subs'ere, XI. 3.
The same general distinction applies to antequam, dum, and
donec ; also to postquam ,· except that, as the sense of the word
hardly allows of the action being represented as not taking
place, it is almost always followed by the indicative (IV. 17).

.10. Non redditas] “Tm non-restitution of the property.” ⁶ ἵ

Non-redds'tos·ms isa noun, exactly like injum'as. See IV. 12.

11. Repetitae sint] In the subjunctive, as being in oratio
ubquua after sudasse (VII. 15).

· 12. Hujusce.] The cc at the end of hujus is called an uulr'tic;
an·enclitic being a little word pronounoed and generally nfitten
