5. Avida] The genitive of the patrive possessor comes pro·
perly, and in the first instance, atter the nouns which name the
objects possessed: as, amor potnit, ‘love of one's country3'
studium lurra, ‘fondness for gain;’ cupido glum, ‘desire of
glory' (ΙΙΙ. ιι). But this construction is frequently extended
to adjectives which correspond in meaning with such nouns;
so that adjectives denoting fondness, desire, dcc, are followed
by the genitive: as, amans patna attached to onescountry
studzbsrur lucri, ‘fond of gain3 ’cupidus glorio, ‘desirous of
glory3' and, as in the text, aubia novarum rerum, ‘eager for
change' SeeXV.4

CHAPTER VII.

1. Cuilibet] Quilquae, quod, διε.) rs generally found ιιι Latln
asthe relative meaning ‘which' Itis also foundasan rndehnr
adjective, meaning ‘tany though ιιι thrs sense the forms quis,
qua, quid, are rather preferred. But qui, ‘,’any is found ιιι
certain indefinite adject wes, which are formed fromit with the
addition of an enclitic—air enclitic being a little word pro·

‹aThus we have the little word libet, ‘it pleases, written
after qui; the two together forming one word quilibet, which
means, any one you please The part qmrsdechned regularly
the part libet remaining unchanged: as, N pai-libet, quo-libet,
q·uodlibet, or qual-brba& G. cujus-libety D. cui- lbet, tie. So too
we shall find uter· libet, ‘whichever of the two you please!

b. Asrmrlar word ιι qur ιιιι composed of qui, ‘,any 'and ιιι,

‘you wislu’ also declined fegularly, and having exac ly the
same meaning as quilibet.

c. In the last chapter we had qumdam, the accusative of qui·
dom; a word composed of qur 'and the enclitic dam Qur'dam
means ‘acertain' object, asif he writer would say ‘Ido not
know, or, ‘Ido not care tot tell you which! lt' rs declined
regularly, except tthat m before dy becomes n: as quen-dam,
quma: ·.dam From it is derived quon- -,dam which means, ‘at

ahcertpfitn time, I do not say when-before or after3' ‘,'lormerly

2. civitatium] The general rule for the genitive pluralis:

‘Parisy llahic nouns take' ιιιιιι, imparisy yllabic take um! civbus,
therefore, being imparisyllabic3 that rs, not having the same
number of syllables' ιιι the nominative as in the other cases3
cibitatum would be regular, and is the more common form. But
in national names ending in as the termination ium is almost
always found, as Arpinas, Arpinatium Αιιιιιιιιιαι, Antemna-
tium (ιΧ); also ιιι the plural nouns penates, ‘guardian gods‚'
and optimates, ‘;'nobles as petrarium, optimatium.
