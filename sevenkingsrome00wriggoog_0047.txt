numerous3 and therefore, to mark them distinctly‚ the noun

should pass through very many cases. But the Romans, it ,

cases. These cases aie subject to the six following laws.

3. lf an object is spoken of as the subs'ect of the sentence, its
noun is in the Nominative case. ·

[Subject from subjectum, ‘laid under,' is used here, in its
ordinary sense, to mean that particular object which is laid
under the sentence (sententm being understood after sub 'ectumj;
that is, the object about which the sentence is made bether
I say, ‘John ran‚' or ‘John carried George,' or ‘John was carried
by George,' 1 select the object named John as the subject or
foundation-stone of my sentence; as that on which 1 mean to
build my sentence np. lt does not follow that this is the object
to which, in my mind, Iattach the most im rtance: but it is
the object towhicb, in the sentence, iassign echief lace; and
it is generally the object which l wish to speak of>as acting.

, ln Latin an object is known to belbe subject, by the word ¹
which names it being in the nominative case: and this word,
whether noun or pronaum we call, not the subject, but the snb-
nno ἱ]

. , , .

4, If an object is spoken of as acted on directly by t e subject,
its noun isin tbe Aceruntive cese.

ι By “iapted on directly’ we mean moved in place or changed
in con r ion

5. If an objectis spoken of as acted on indirectly by the

subject, its noun is in the Dative case.

By this we mean that the object is conceived, not os moved
or changed, butas in some way or other affected by the action.

6. If an object is spoken of as possessing another object, its
noun is in the Genitive case.

7. If an object is addressed, its noun is in the Vocative msc

8. If an objectis spoken of as subsidzbry to tbe action of the
subject, its noun is in the Ablative case.

By this we mean that the object is not conceived as in any
way affected by the action, but is introduced into the sentence
to explain, or tell something more about it.

9. Conceiving, then, that an object may always be regarded as
placed in some one or other of these six groups of circumstances ;
that is, as the subject of the sentence, as acted on directly by
the subject, as acted on indirectly, as possessing, as addressed,
or as subsidiary to the action; and that the several cases of the
noun point out the object as inone or other of these six groups;
we shall endeavour, in the following Notes, to account for the
cases of nouns by referring them to one or other of the six
above-mentioned general laws.
