time. But there is no ambiguity here. It is quite clear what
the words victory and slanghter tell about the fighting. ln this
sentence, indeed, there are three ablatives, pm'ma being the
ablative neuter from primus. But almost all notion of an ablativa
is lost in the adverbial use of the word.

2. Agedum] Age, the imperative of ago, is used as an excla-
mation of encouragement: ‘come ont’ ‘quickt' ‘stir your-
self' To this dum, ‘while' is added as an enclitic: so that
agedum means ‘quick fora moment l' ‘come now l ’ ‘now then !'
Dum follows in this manner negatives; as, nandum, necdum,
vixdum: and imperatives3 as here, and adesdum, ‘here for a
moment!

3. Possit] The subject-word to possit is the omitted ante·
¹ cedent to quad. ‘

4 Rern expertus] See XXVII, 11.

2. Ubi nusquam] “ln which they nowhere came to a
general engagement.” Ubi (originallycuhi) is a sort of case from
qui, meaning ‘ in ' or ‘· at which.' Generally it means, ‘at which-
place‚’ ‘where :’ olten, ‘at which—time,’ ‘when’ Usquam and
nusquam, ‘at any—place,’ and ‘at no-place‚’ are formed from
quisquam, ‘any ς’ and so are unquam and autequam, ‘at any—
time,’ and ‘at rio-time’

3. AEdem—Jovis.] AEdes or adz's (the older form) means
originally ‘roonr‚' ‘ayartmentfl but has, in the singular, the
special sense ‘temple as consisting of a single room. In the
plural it means ‘a house ς’ that is, a collection of rooms. So
litera means ‘a letter of the alphabet :' litera, ‘a letter’ or
‘cpistle ;’ that is, a collection of letters of the alphabet.

a. Hence arises a difficulty about these words. For ades may
mean either ‘temples,⁷ or ‘a house,’ or, as there is no plural of
the plural, ‘houses.‘ To obviate in some measure this confusion,
distributive numerals are used instead of cardinals. Thus-

Dua ades means ‘two ternples ;’ but,

Bina ades, ‘two houses.'

Quotam litera, ‘four letters of the alphabet ;' but,

Quaterna luera, ‘four epistles.'

b. Singula is not used in this way instead of urta. For the
confusion arises, when we wish to speak of mor‘e objects than
one-of more temptes, or of more houses than one; and then,
