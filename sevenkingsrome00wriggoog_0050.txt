enne. 1. · 41

Beside the genitive domas ‘of ahouse,’ there is the form domi,
meaning ‘in the house,’ ‘at home' Remember that αὀηικε
andrus, like the names of towns and small islands, do not take
prepositions before them, when naming the, place to or from
which motion is directed, orat which an action is performed
(Ἠ. VIII. 20). But in prose prepositions are, with few ex·
ceptione, placed in such circumstances before the names of
countries and all other nouns. Com arethenouns Macedoniam,
agrum, urbe, duc, in this and the folidwing sentences.

4. ln Macedoniam] Observe the difference between the
prepositions (1) in and ex, and (2) ad and ab. In (with the
accusative) andex denote motion ‘to' and ‘from’ the 'insede
of a place: ad and ab (ora) denote motion ‘to’ and ‘from'
the outside of a place: , Thus you have in Macedoniam, because
AEneas entered into Macedonia3 ex urbe, because the natives
came out of the city. But ad agrum, because in this sentence
at least no notion of his entering the Laurentiun territory is
conveyed: just as by ab Sicilia no notion of his coming out of
Sicily is conveyed. He himself did actually come out ; but this
is not expressed. What is expressed is, that from outside Sicily
he sailed in his fleet (which did not enter either the one or the
other) to outside the Laurentian territory. ·

5. Macedoniam] Virgil, singing ln the AEneid the wander· ι
ings of AEneas, c'ar'ries him first to the shore's oi Thrace. Livy,
in accordance with a legend more prevalent among the Greeks,
brings him to the peninsula ot' Pallene in Macedonia; where he
is said to have founded the town AEnea

6. Siciliam] A small island, containing only one town and
its adjoining territory, as Naxos or Delos, was regarded as a
town: and therefore its name, like tlre name of a town, is used
without a preposition. Buta large island, as Sicily, could not
be so regarded; and therefore its name, like the name of a
country, is used with a preposition. Islands of intermediate
size, as Cyprus, seem sometimes to have been regarded as towns,
sometimes as countries: for we find their names both with and
without prepositions3 but more frequently without

7. Delatus] The first meaning oi the preposition deis
‘down from:' as, ruunt de montibus amnes ,· ‘down from
mountains rush the streams.’ And this meaning is frequently
retained in compositioni as in demitto, ‘let down ;' tle-scendo,
‘climb down,' ‘descend’ So tle-fero means, ‘bring down,'
and thence, ‘bring into port:’ because, as the sea looks higher
than the land, a ship seems to come down, as it comes to shore.
The compound delatus est agrees with AEneas as subject-word,
understood from the preceding sentence. And so does navi·
