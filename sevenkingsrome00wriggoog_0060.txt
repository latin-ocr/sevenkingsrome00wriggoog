tinus. It stands still, and receives the name. Compare Deus
nobas kaecotiuficr't. Virg. E. Ι. 6.

10. Maximus] Caiusfuit major natu quam Balbus, ‘Caius
was older than Balbus ;' literally ‘greater in point of birth!
Natu is in the ablative‚ as naming the object that specifies the
superiority, just as studea and fide were in the ablative, as
naming the objects that specified the yielding (II. 10). But
often the word natu is omitted ; and masur alone means ‘older'
(as. inhthe noun minares, ‘ancestors'j3 and maximus, ‘oldesa'
as rnt etext.

11. Patris-aetatis] Our law for the genitive is: ‘If an
object is spoken of as possessing another object, its noun is in
the genitive case' Α

a. Nowan object may possess another object intwo ways. Caii
amor may mean ‘love felt by Caius ;' forif Caius feels love, he
posscsses it as one of his feelings. Alsa, Caii amur may mean
‘love felt for Caius ;’ for if love is felt for Caius, he possessas it
as a thing belonging to him. We show this by such expressions
as ‘Give me your love ;' for, if the love is given me, Ipossess
it as much as 1 should possess a book or any other object that
might be given me. In either sense then Caii is in the genitive,
as naming the possessor of the love; and, by way of distinc-
tion, we may say that when Caii amor means ‘love felt by
Caius‚' Caii is in the genitive, as naming the active possessor
(foras he feels love, he acts) 3 when Caii amor means ‘love felt
sor Caius‚' Caiiis in the genitive, as naming the passive posses·
sor (for some one else acts on him). Thus in the text patris is
in the genitive, as naming the active possessor; for the father
feels the wish. AEtata's is in the genitive, as naming the passive
possessor; for age possesses respect as a thing belonging to it,
but which others feel. The father acts 3 age is acted upon.

b. The genitive of the passive possessor is sometimes called
the objectiw genz'tr've. But this is a term we cannot adopt, both
because it does not elucidate the idea of the genitive, and be-
cause the word ‘objective' implies a sense of the word ‘object'
different from that in which we always understand it, viz. as
anything whatever ‘objected,' or laid before the mind tint. L).

c. Also, the genitive of the passive possessor is sometimes
called the genitive of the cause, and is explained thus. Α
cause may be conceived as possessing an effect3 for the effect
comes out of the cause, and therefore has been in, or possessed
by, it. When, therefore, Caii amor means ‘love felt for Caius‚'
Caii is said to be in the genitive, as naming the cause ont of
which the effect ‘love’ is come. This explanation isvery fair
as far as it goes, bnt it will not be found to hold always (XI. 6).
We shall, therefore, adopt the genitive of the cause as aspecial
head of the general division, the ‘genitive of the passive pos-
