adsperge, ‘sprinkle on' and ‘bespattem’ induo, ‘put on' and
‘clothe 3' as, vestem puella induo, and puellam veste induo.

3 Infesto] Infntus, an old participle from infero, means
literally, ‘carried against‚’ ‘presented at.’ Knights charging
with spears in rest would charge irgestis hastae. (bmpare in·
festis armis concurrunt, XXI. 5. enee the secondary sense
which it has here ; ‘hostile’ ‘dangerous'

4. Exercitu] From Note XIII. 2,cum exercitu might pos-
sibly be expected here3 for the army might be conceived
as simply accompanying Tullus. But more than mere accom-
paniment is expressed. Livy does not mean to spealr of Tullus
and the army as coming together on terms of equality3 but to
show the manner in which Tullus comes-as an enemy at the
head of his army, in hostile array.

5. stativis] The adjective statinus (from sto) means ‘sta-
tionary! Stativa castra, therefore, means. ‘stationary camp!
Which two words being frequently used together, statana came
to be used alone in the same sense; ‘stationary camp,¹ ‘head
quarters3¹ or simply, ‘camp' when pitched for more than one
night. SImilarly cani stands alone, without capilli, to mean
‘grey hairs3’ dextra and sinestra, without manus, to mean
‘right’ and ‘left hand* So, too, primas (without partes) agere,
‘to play first parts ;’ calidam (without aquam) potare, ‘to drinlr
warin water.' This use of tbe adjective must nothe confused
with that explained XI. 4, where the adjective, by the mere
force of its gender, passes into nouns naming men, women, and
things of a certain sort.

6. Ducit] Just as stativa oame to be used alone, without
castra, in the same sense as the two words combined ; so ducr't
is sometimes used without medeam in the sense, ‘leads his
army,' ‘marchen' ‘moves‘ as here ; and edua't, a little below.
