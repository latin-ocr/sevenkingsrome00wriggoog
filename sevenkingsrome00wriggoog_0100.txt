cnunc· ιιιιι. ’ ιιι-ς

’ςζ Infestis] See ΧΙΧ. 3. .
6. remu] This distributive numeral implies ‘the three on'·
euch side 3' that is, the six. See XIV. 7.

’ 7. Nec hia] ⁴⁴ Neither ιο the Roman nor to the Alban three
does their own danger present itself.” His and illis are in the
dative, as naming the objects operated on indirectly‚ not moved
or changed, by the act of presentation. And so is animo, just
below; only lris and illis name the whole persons 3 animo the.
part specially influenced by the presentation.

’8. Fecissent.] See XX. 5. The past tense os fecissent is
,owing to the word futura ; ‘and the destiny srom that day
about to be to their country, the destiuy which they themselves
had made’ When the destiny comes into being, the making
it is past And it is ficissent, not ficerint, because the main·
verb observatur rs in the historical present. Futura sortem
should be regarded as one noun, like proedrc αιιιιιιιι, ¹.1V 12:

‘and the fact that from that day sorward their country's destiny
would be such as they themselves should make 1t.’

9 ΝειιιιοἉ] To neither side The adverbs rnoanswerthe
question, whither? as, isto, to that place by you ’illo, to that
place youder eo, eodem „quo utro, &c 'lhe terminatmrlowould
seem to imply that these were originally ablat' t;1ves but there rs
nothing ιιι the idea of the ablative case answering to the-
question, whither? rThis question is answered by the accusa·
tive, never by the ablative. It has been supposed, therefore,
that these adverbs are old accusatives (ιἰιι-ιιι, illo-m) that have
lost the final m ; and this view seems supported hythe fact that,
beside ιἰιι aud illo, we have istuc, r'llnc, also meaning ‘thither 3’
a‘nd these are neuter accusatives srom istic, illic (XIX. ιι).
Isto then would be, ιἰιιιιι locum, ‘to that place by you ;’ istnc,
‘to that by y0u3’ the neuter istuc meaning generally, ‘that
which is by you,’ just as verum means ‘that which is true' (XI.
4 d). Further, it may be said that the demonstrative hic has
no adverb lio, meaning ‘hither‚' because it has no accusative
without the enclitic ce (as Ιιιιιιι οι hom, like illum or illem). It
only bas linc, like illuc, with the enclitic.

10. spectaculo. ] This' ts rather a peculiar use of the dative.
Eo res Caio magnae ιιι curre, ‘that matter is a great care or
anxiety ιο Caius3’ ‘in the light osa great care’ Sc, Cesar
legiones dnus praesr'dro castris reliquit, ‘Caesari let ι two legions as
agarnsonforthecamp) Hoc vitro militant, ‘this they set
down as a fault to me' Caius rem -Ιιιιιίιιαιιι qnoestui titan,

‘Caius looked on the state as a source of gaiu’ Eam reni
religioni habuit, ‘he took the event as awaming from heaven!
Incumbite' ιιι sludium eloquentie, utet vobis honori, elamitis
utilitati, et reipublice emolnmento ιιιι possint. (Cic de Orat

1..8)
