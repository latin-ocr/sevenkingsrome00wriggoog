10. Ominum] “Ignorant of all that was going on’' For 1113
genitive, see XV. 4 Omnium means ‘of all things) It wool
be more usual to say omnium rerum ; because we cannot tell by
the form whether omnium means ‘oi all persons,’ or ‘oi all
things' But we should be sate in saying 11111110 101 ‘all things ;'
because the termination marks the gender. Ι500 XI. 4 e.

11. Purgando.] “In making excuses.” Purgo, ‘clear away,’
‘cleanse,’⁴ excuse,’ being a transitive verb, we should expect
an accusative, as se; which is perhaps omitted, as it occurs
so soon after, 101 the sale 01 euphony. This use 01 purgo
without an accusative may be compared with the intransitive
use 01 inclino, XV. 5; and with the use 01 duco without exer·

, citum XIX. 6: but it does not seem exactly to resemble either.

⁴ 12. Se invitos] In the oratio obliqua 01101 1110 idea 01 saying
implied in purgando (IX. 4). Our way in English is not to make
a dependent sentence, as in Latin. ‘They would be very sorry,
they pleaded, to say anything at all displeasing to Tullus: but
they were constrained by their orders. They were come to
demand restitution. It it were not granted, they were ordered

, 10 declare war.' Tullus replies in 1111111101111110,ι ‘Take back

word, &e’

13. Troianam] ‘⁶ Each 01 the two being a Trojan race, inas·
much as Lavinium was sprung from Troy, rom Lavinium Alba,
from the stock 01 Alban kings the Romans.”

n. Haud plus] The construction is not altered by the Ἴ

words haud plus. They are inserted as though they were an
adverb, ‘The Albans pitch their camp five miles, no more,

from 11110 city 3’ millu being in the accusative, as naming the ¹
1111101111, So, cum decem haud plus mz‘llibus militum, ‘with ten 1

thousand soldius, no more.’ Livy, XXVIII. 1.
