cuna. xxm. 97

15. Orbum liberis] The noun after orbus may also be in
the genitive (XXI. 1): but in prose it is usually in the ablative‚
as naming the object from which motion is directed.

16. Liberis] The four following words should be carefully
distinguished: Liber, libera, liberum, G. liber-i, ‘free :’ Liber,
G. Liber-i, an Italian deity corresponding to the Greek Bacchus:
Liberi} G. liber-orum, the singular being hardly ever found
(Vll. 12), ‘children :² and Uber, G. libr-i, m, ‘rind,’ or ‘inner
bark of a tree3’ hence (from its ancient use for writing on)
‘book :' just as our word ‘book' comes from ‘beech‚’ because
the Saxons used to write on thin beechen boards.

17. Hunccine] Hunc itself is componnded of the old de-
monstrative and the enclitic ce (XIX. 12). But forgetting this,

the Romans sometimes add another ce; as they would to .

illum, which 'then becomes illunc or illunce. And to this is
added still another enclitic κζ· the ci before ni hecoming ci:
as, huncci, nunccine,- illunci, illnncini. This enclitic ne is used
in questions, being added to the most important word, which it
renders emphatic: mistaten mi frater, mi frater, cries Cicero,
tune id vernus es? ‘Could you of all men suspect? ’

18. Incedentem.] In its first meaning, ‘walking with stately
step’ See XIV. 2, a.

19. Eum] As usual, with a logical force (XVI. 2). Huncce
means ‘this man whom 1 hold In my arms, whom 1 show to
you ;’ referring to the object as perceived by the sens'es. Eum
means ‘the man of whom l have just said such things'-‘this
man, I say ;’ referring to the words just utterecl in the sentence.

CHAPTER XXIII.

1. Transitionis. ‘⁴ Bya promise that the Albans would
cross over to them! The Albans possess the truiisitio actively‚
for they were to make it; and the transilii possesses the
promise passively‚ asa thing attached to it. The order of the
words seems to point to this construction. Otherwise we might
consider both Albanorum and transitionis in the genitive (of the
active and passIve possessor) aster pactu.

2. Descissent.] See Il. 17. Though descisco is of the third
conjugation‚ its perfect forins descivi, dcc, resemble, and are
contracted, like those of the fourth. ,

3. Confluentes] “ At the confluence of the Anio with the ⁴

Tiber.'' As the Tiber has not been mentioned, it would seem
that this spot was called Confluentes, ‘the meeting rivers: ' juxt
