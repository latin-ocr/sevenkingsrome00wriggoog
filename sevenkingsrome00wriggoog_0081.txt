CHAPTER XII.

1. Quum-‘divideretj “' Since at the time he was dividing.”
Quum dividebat would mean simply, ‘At the time when he was
dividing ;’ and no connection would be implied between the
dividing and the naming. But the subjunctive divideret denotes
the dependence oi the dividing on the naming: a dependence,
not after and real, as when the purpose is denoted (11. 8); but
before and merely verbal. Romulus actually was dividing; but
the dividing is not stated as a lact by itseli but mentioned to
show how it was that he carne to give the names. This
‘dependence belore’ comprehends every mode in which an
action can be represented as bearing upon the main action. In
quum—agerent, a little below, it denotes a reason against the
main action Here it does not exactly denote the reason for it,
or cause, bnt rather the monum The king’s gratitude to the
Sabine women was the cause ol his giving their names to his
new curia: his dividing the people into curie shows how it was
that he was able to do them this honour.

2. Quumque-agerent] “And though at the time the
Laurentians demanded satisfaction in accordance with the law
oi nations, the influence and entreaties oi his relations had
rnore effect with Tatius.” Agerentis in the subjunctive, as
denoting a reason against the main action: see last note, and
11.18. Jureisin the ablative‚ asexplaining agermt. It names
the ntanner in which they acted They acted as the law of
natityns showed thern how to act. To act thus was to demand
satis action

3. Suotum.] a. The rule is that the reflexives sui and suus
refer to the subject ol the sentence, as se does in the next
sentence (ΙΙ. 4). But it is not considered a violation oi the
rule, ii they refer to the object, which is the subject ol the
sentence in sense, though not in mmar. Gratia and preces
name the grammatical subJects o this sentence3 but the real
subject. about which the sentence is made, is Tatius: as it it
ran, ‘Tatius was more influenced,' &ca

b. Suorum does not agree with hominum understood Mei
means ‘people belonging to me’—in any way, friends, relations,
soldiers, &c., as the context shows. Μία means, ‘things belong·
ing to me‚' ‘my property! And so, too, the other possessives,
tuus, suus, noster, vester, are used in the plural as nouns. It
is the gender of the adjective that gives it the power ol thus
naming persons and things: not any word omitted with which

the adjective agrees. Mei no more agrees with homines
