the difference between the verb and adjective is chiefly one of
form, the verb being so much more flexible, See H. VII.

36, dic.

4. Ut qui—regnaret] “Inasmuch as he was reigning
pecatalygr„ by order of the people, nor with the sanction of the

5. Accedebat] “To this was added, that by one, who placed
no hope in the affections of his countrymen, the throne was only
to be defended by ter1·or.” The construction with accedit is either
ut with the subjunctive, as here, or quod with the indicative;
as quod occiderunt, XXXV. 12. If the added circumstance
is stated, not as actually existing, but only as conditional, quod
is not used, but only ut. In such constmctions accedit is some-
times said to be impersonal, that is to have no subject-word:
but the clause, as ut—-esset‚ or quodeoccziz'erunt‚ may be con·
sidered to name the subject of the sentence. In XXXV. 12,
indeed, the subject-word is id,· and the following clause explains
whatzil is.

6. Nihil spei] Compare tbe genitives, IX. 6.

7. Bonis multare] “To punish by confiscation.” Multare
means ‘to punish3' and bonis is in the ablative, as specifying the
objects in which he was able to punish them (ll. 10, b). Of
course to be punished in our goods is to be punished by the
loss of them.

8. Sed unde] “But all from whom.’' Unde, originally
cunde (as in ali-cunde), from qui, means ‘from which) It de-
pends, therefore, on the context whether it means ‘from which
place,’ or ‘from which time,' or ‘from which circumstance,' or
‘from which persons‚' as here. The word which naturally serves
as antecedent to the relative qui (and the adverbs formed from
it) is the logical demonstrative is (and the adverbs formed from
it), as they both have to do with words, not things. But often
the antecedent is omitted before qui (VII. 18); aud so it may
‚ be before the adverbs formed from it, as in the text. Compare
is and qui. eo and quo, ihi and ubi, inde and unde, itu and ut, jum ¹
and quum.

9. Posset] The subjunctive here marks the uncertainty as to
who these persons were.

ro. Quo contemption] Quo, the ablative neuter from qui,
is commonly used, instead of ut, with the comparative adjective.
The literal rendering is, ‘by which means the order would be
more contemptible: which readily passes into the meaning,
‘in order that the order might be more contemptible.' Com·
pare quin, IV. 15. This s'nows how ut, the adverb of manner
from qui, meaning ‘in which manner,’ carne to mean ‘that’
