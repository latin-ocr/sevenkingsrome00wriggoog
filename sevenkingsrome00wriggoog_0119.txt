9. Regis criminibus] See III. 11. Here the passive pos·
sessor cannot be regarded as the cause.

CHAPTER XXXV.

1. Agendae ret] “The time for action.'’ Action possesses
the time passively as a thing appertaining to it. For the noun
agenda-rei, see V. ι.

2. In seda] Observe the preposition in after sedens, and also
after considere, a little below. See XXVII. 4 and XXXII. 10.
These 'instances are sufficient to show that it may be inserted
or not. Perhaps in the text it is owing to the number of
ablatives in the sentence.

3. Hoc tei] See IX. 6.

4 Audacia] In the ablative, as naming the accompanying
cause of the daring (IX. 7).

5. Tenere] His words were, patris mei tenea sedem, ‘I hold
my father’s seat.’ When the words are narrated in aratia obliqua
after quatre-respondam, ‘having answercd‚' the tense of the
verb depends in English on the tense of the main verb, but in
Latin it remains the samer quum respondisset se patris sui tenere
sedena, tenere remainin in the present; ‘having answered that
he did but hold his inhers seat‚' ‘did hold' being in a past
tense, because ‘having answered' isin apest tense. The reason
of the difference· is this: in English, the clause after ‘that’ is
subordinate to the main sentence; and therefore the tense in
the subordinate clause naturally follows the tense of the main
verb, just as in Latin the tense of the subjunctive does (VII. 15
and I. 12). But in Latin quum-sedem is only one sentence, the
infinitive team (as well asse) being a noun in the accusative
case after respondisset. Whom did he answer about? HImselt
Therefore seis in the accusative. What did he answer about?
Holding. Therefore lenm is in the accusative. And as his
answer was about ‘holding' at the time when he made the
answer, not about ‘having held’ at any ast time, the Latin
must be tenere, not tenuisse, whatever be tie tense of the main
verb. See XXVII. 8.

6. Apparebatque. “And it was evident that he who con·
quered would be king.'’ Not vinceret, ‘should conquer,’ but
vr'cisset, ‘should have conquered‚’ because the conquering is to
be past before the reigning begins. Not visat, ‘shall have
conquered‚' because apparebat is in the past tense. The simple
sentence is, regnabat qui vemt, ‘he who conquers shall bc lting3’
visast being in the future perfect indicative. Then the present
compound sentence is, apparet reparaturum qui at'cerit (in the per-
