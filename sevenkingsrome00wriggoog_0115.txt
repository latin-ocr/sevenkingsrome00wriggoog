‘plural-only' nouns which name a single object (Vll, 12), as
castra, ‘camp ;’ not because they require it to prevent con·

resemblance. AEdes, ‘house‘ names a single object, and so does
castra, ‘camp :’ hence we say, bina cedes, ‘two houses ;’ bina
castra, ‘two camps’ But liberi names more objects than one:
hence, as usual, tres liberi, quatuor liberi, &c

Who is affected hythe head belng entire? He to whom the
head belongs. Theresore his noun puero is in the dative ; and,
standing first ln the sentence, shows that he has a concern in all
{that follows. This may be expressed in English by the some·
lwhat awkward tum: ‘a slave-boy had his head on· fire.' So,
‘Numitor had his beart touched!
