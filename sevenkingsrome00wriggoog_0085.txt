t. Corporis] “One of their own body.'' Corporis is in the
genitive, as naming the possessor of the unknown individual.

2. Incessit] Cedo means originally (Il. 11), ‘move quietly,'
‘walk,' without conveying a notion either of going away or
coming. Jncedo means ‘move' or ‘walle alongz' in meaning
‘in,' or ‘on ;' as, in Appio oio, ‘in,' ‘0n‚' or ‘along the Appian
way.' From this comes (a) ‘walk with stately step,' ‘stalk,’
‘strut,’ as one walks along a parade: (b) ‘walk forwards,’
‘advance’ It iswith the latter meaning that we have todo.
Now, suppose an object, asfear, advances; inwhat circumstances
is the object placed on whom it advances? We should say that
it is acted on indirectly by fear; not being moved or changed,
but affected thereby: and therefore we should put its noun in
the dative case. Accordingly, it is good Latin to say, tinm
Patribus incessit, ‘fear carne upon the F athers’ But it isquite
possible to conceive the object as acted on directly by sear
advancing3 a's changed from a calm to afrightened condition:
and therefore its noun may also be put in the accusative, as
here, timor Patres incessit. So that incedo comes to be used as
a transitive verb, with the meaning, ‘attack,' ‘seize' Incedo,
therefore, if we look to its origin, is intransitive, and followed ’
byanouu in the dative; or it maybe joined to nouus by pre-
positions, as m or od. Again, if we look to its ultimate meaning,
it is transitive 3 and, as such, is followed by a noun in the accu-
sative 1t is not well to account for the accusative, by referring
it to the preposition in contained in the compound ; because we
cannot thus account for the accusative after excedo, ‘go out
from,’ ‘depost' We may say either excedo urbe, urbe naming
the object that tells something more about the departure; or,
excedo urbem, ‘I quit the city,' the city being conceived as aban·
doned. Note should be taken of these verbs that are both
intransitive and transitive, that are followed both by the dative
or abladve, and hythe accusative. Fugio is oue: see H. p. 144.
So, too, are invado and evado.

3. Circacivitatiumj “Of many of the states around” Circo
is both preposition; and adverb, as here. Used thus, it serves
the purpose os an adjective, there being no corresponding
adjective circus. If there were, we might have circorum, ‘many
of the surrounding states’ Com are ex orontiius, qui circo
suist, IV. 4. For cioz'totium, see 11. 2.

4 Adoriretur.] “Should attack.'' Adon'or is in its origin
