here can be no doubt that, if I carry or kill Caius, Iact on
him directly, so as to move or change him: but it ma be
doubted whether 1 aet thus upon him, when Ι love or please
him. In other words, it may be doubted whether ‘love’ and
‘plesse’ are transitive or intransitive verbsr but there can be
no doubt that ‘carry' and ‘hill’ are transitive 3 just as, on the
other hand, there can be no doubt that ‘run’ and ‘walk' are
intransitive. We need not, therefore, be surprised to find that
the same action has been viewed differently by the Romans and
the English, so that the verb denoting it is transitive in one
language, intransitive in the other. Now in English we know a
verb to be transitive, if it is followedby a noun without a
preposition3 as, ‘I carry Caius z ' in Latin, if it is followed by
a noun in the accusative ; as, parvo Caium. All other' verbe we
hold to be intransitive. This, it must be remembered, is not
the definition, but the test, of transitive and intransitive verbs.
It is the test of the light in which an action was regarded by
Romans and English

Take, for example, verbs denoting emotions of the mind : as,
love, hate, fear, envy, grief. Α mo, odi, timeo, are transitive3 and
so are the verbs, ‘love,¹ ‘hate' ‘sear' Invideo is intransitive,
but ‘envy' is transitive. Doleo is transitive, but ‘grieve' is'
intransitive. So again placeo and displiceo are intransitive;
but ‘please’ and ‘displease’ are transitive. Thus, in the text,
Tullo is in the dative after driplicet: but we say, ‘the plan
does not displease Tullus' The Romans, therefore, conceive
that,if Ι please or displease Tullus, Iact on him indirectly‚ so
as to influence or affect him ε but not directly, so as to move or
change him. There will generally be something in the origin
of the verb to account for the light in which the action is
regarded. But, whether this be observed or not, the pupil
should carefully note down and commit to memory every verb
he meets with, which in Latin is followed by a noun in the
dative3 but in English by a noun without a preposition.

agent after passive verbs to be put in the ablative with the
