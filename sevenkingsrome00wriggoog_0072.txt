cunr. vn. 63

actually taking place. The secking is dependent on the sending,
both verbally and really. Instead of the adjective qui, the
adverb ut, ‘in order that' (th 18), may be used before a verb
denoting the purpose. In English we commonly use the
infinitive mood. Thus, for ‘he sent ambassadors to sue for
peace,' we may have, misit legatos nt pacem peterent ,· but more
elegantly, qnipacem peterent, as in the text.

5. Adeo] “To such an extent did they at once despise,'' dcc.
Adeo, compounded of od and the pronominal adverb eo, ‘there-
to,' means (1) ‘up to the point spoken of‚' ‘so ε’ (2) ‘in addition
to the thing spoken of,' ‘moreoven' We also have, com-
pounded with acl, the adverb quoad, ‘up to what‚’ ‘how far,'
‘how long3' and adhuc, ‘up to this time present‚' ‘hitherto'
For the exact meaning of zi, from which co comes, see XV. 13
and for eo, see XXI. 9 and 25.

s. masmanna] “Dissembling.” samua means ‘ pretend
that which is not ς’ dissimulo, ‘hide that which is.' Thus, Quod
non est simulo, dissimuloqne qnod est.

7. Ex industria] “Institutes on purpose games sacred to
Neptune, father of horses.'' The Roman sea-god Neptune was
identified with the Greek Poseidon, who, beside being god of
the sea, was regarded as creator of the horse, and originator of
horse-meing: Compare Virg. Georg. Ι. 12.

Sollennn (from annus, ‘year,' the first part of the word being
obscure) meant originally ‘taking place every year;’ hence
‘stated' ‘appointed' Then, being applied to religious festivals,
in consequence of their recurring at stated times, it carne to
mean ‘festiva' ‘solemn' ‘sacred' as here, And further, the
neuter form sollenne passes, as frequently happens, into a noun ;

with the sense ‘solemn rite‚’ ‘festival,' ‘solemnity.' See cujm
ad sollenne, a little below, and XI. 4

8. Quanto] Tantus, the antecedent to quantus, is frequently
omitted. The full sentence would be: Tanto id apparatu con·
celebrant, quanto tum sciebant autpoterant concelebrare.

9. Multi mortales] “A great many people came to the
show, from a desire too of seeing the new city3 especially the
inhabitants os the several nearest towns, Caenina, Crustumium
(or Crustumerium), and Antemna” Etiam means ‘beside wish-
ing to see the show.'

10. videndae] Urbis-vallendoe, ‘city-seeing‚’ to be taken as
one noun, is in the genitive as naming the passive possessor,

g( cepisse, of the desire (V. 1). For the ablative studio, see

11. Quique] a. Here is another enclitic qne appended to
quis or qui,· see note 1. But only quir is used in the nominative
singular, as quisque, qunque, qualique, or qnodque; G. ausasqne, &c
