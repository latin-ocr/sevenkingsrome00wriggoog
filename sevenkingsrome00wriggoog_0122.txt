cnse. xxxvrr. 113

Ut may be used, as well as quo, with a comparative adjective z
as, nt tutin esset, a little below.

11. Cum quibua] “With whom he pleased.'’ Here, again,
the antecedent is omitted, though it requires a prepositionz
‘with those with whom he pleased.'

12. Famae credimus] ‘Believe’ is transitive in English;
but credo, meaning ‘believe,' is intransitive, as its origin indi-
cates It comes from a root cre, ‘saith 3' and do, ‘put’ (XIX. 2).
The object, then, in which we put faith is not moved, and
therefore its noun isnot in the accusative3 but it is concerned
n our doing so, and therefore its noun is in the dative.

13. Ei Mamilio] Notice this mode of repeating a word
aster a parenthesis: ‘To Mamilius I say3’ ἐς, as usual, having
reference to what has been said in the sentence.

CHAPTER XXXVIL

r. Volscis movit] The war was moved, the Volsci were
not moved. Hence the cases (Π. 5).

2. Refecisset.] The particle re, or red, is only found in corn·

position, and primarily denotes ‘back :’ as, reddo, ‘put back,’ >

‘repay' This notion of ‘back’ is sometimes, however, not very
easily traced, and sometimes appears to be altogether lost.
Here it refers not to the talents, but to the booty. He got rid
of the booty, and received in return for it—that is, ‘back ’-the
talents. ln English, we should not express this, but simply
say, ‘When by the sale of the booty he had made forty talents.’
Compare preda vetulendo qnoestari datm quod inde refectum est
ma‘lt'ti dannan (Livy, XXXV. 1). Also reponenti, XXXVI. 5.

3. Digna-rege] Dignus comes, apparently, from the root
dic: from which comes in Greek, helenuna,- ‘point out;' and ln
Latin, ‹in-o, ‘tell;’ indic-0, ‘point out3’ also δάκτυλος and
drgr'tus, ‘finger,’ literally, ‘pointer ε’ hence in French, dn'gt, and
in English, ‘digit' Dignus, therefore, means, primarily, ‘pointed
out τ’ hence ‘remarkable’ ‘deserving,' ‘virorthy’ The object,
then, which is specified as that of which another object is
worthy has naturally its noun in the ablative case (Il. ιο).
Dignus is rarely found with the genitive, but frequently with
aspijnffi sentence: as, dignm est qni imperet, ‘he is worthy
to e. ·

4 Deum] See XXXIII. 1.

5. Lentius spe] ‘More lingering than he expected! Com-

jjoe') eo quum celerius omnium opinione venisset (Caes. Β. G.
. 3.
