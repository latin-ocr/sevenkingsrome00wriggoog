10. Peragrare.] Observe this useof ’ the infinitive. The
infinitive is properly a noun, and stands in a sentence, either in
the nominative, as, peragrare est jucundum, ‘roaming is pleasant ;'
or in the accusative (without a preposition), as, cupio peragrare,
‘I desire to roam ς’ the other cases being supplied by the
gerunds. See last note, and H. VIII. 5, and 14 But in the
text the infinitive is used like a verb in the imperfect indicative ;
‘they roamed,’ ‘began to roam,' or ‘used to roam’ No doubt
this construction arose from the proper one; as if from the
sentences, cuperant peragrare, or solebant peragrare, ‘they ἵ
began,' or ‘used to roam‚' the verbs cuperant and solebant had
dropped out. But in practice all notion of an omitted verb
is lost, and the infinitiva is used just as a verb in the indicative,
when the writer, after relating events, passes on to a state ol
things that has just commenced 3 or when he wishes to set before
his readers a picture of a series of actions following one another
in rapid successim, without referring them to a particular time.
Hence several such infinitives are commonly found together,
as peragrare, subsistere, facere. They are called Historical
infinitives. ·

11. Corporibus.]1n the dative after sumpto. As in the
active we might have, robur corporibus sumpserunt, ‘they took
up strength to their bodies ;' so in the passive we may have,
robore corporibus sumpto, ‘strength being taken up to their
bodies' In either construction the bodies are spoken of as
acted on in precisely the same way, viz. indirectly3 and there·
iore their noun is in the dative case (II. 5).

12. Praedae amisson] “Out of resentment for the loss of
their booty.’' Praedo is in the genitive, as naming the cause
of the resentment (III. 14). But, observe, it is not the booty
by itself that causes the resentment, hut ‘losing the booty,’
‘the loss of the booty.' This is a common construction in
Latin. A perfect passive participle is made to agree with a
noun, when we wish to speak, not so much of the object named
hy the noun, as of the action denoted by the participle. Re·
member this construction, when translating into LatIn the
English infinitive in ing, or verbal noun. ‘The killing (or mur·
der) of the king terrified me ;’ interfectus-rex me terruit. Here
you have it in the nominative; in the text you have it in the
genitive And at ‚the end of this book (XLIII. 4) you will find
it in the accusative and ablativo, ab condrio urbe od liberatum,
‘from the city built to the city freed,’ that is, ‘from the building
of the city to its deliverance.'

13. Numitori] ‘The recollection touched the heart.' Who
was affected by the heart being touched? Clearly he whose

heart was touched ; that is, Numitor. Therefore Numitori is in '

the dative case. But though the dative may he thus explained
