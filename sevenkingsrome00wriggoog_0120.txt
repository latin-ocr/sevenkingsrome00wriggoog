lec’t subjunctive j: and the past compound sentence is, apparebat
regnaturum qui vt'cr'sset, the tense of the subjoined verb being
attracted as usual by the tense os the main verb. See XX. 5.

7. Medium arripit] “Snatches up Servius by the waist,
and, carrying him out of the senate-house, dashes him down the
steps to the ground below.'' Notice this constant use of the
perfect passive participle agreeing with the noun os the object
acted upon, where we use an active participle agreeing with the
noun of the agent, or more commonly a verb conjoined to an·
other by ‘and’ Elatum regem dejecit ,· he carried out the king
and hurled him down' Compare the same words, elatam securim
in caput dejecit: XXXII. 3.

8. ld quod constat] “A fact which is sufficiently esta·

primarily‚ ‘do eagerly,' ‘despatch' ‘execute ε ’ as, jussa facessi-

end‚’ ‘have done with ς’ and as, when we have done with a
thing, we leave it, it comes to mean simply, as an intransitive
verb, ‘withdraw,' ‘reare' ‘depart,' as in the text.

11. Monumento.] “And the place still tells the tale ''-
‘serves as a monument ol the decd’ In the dative os endor
