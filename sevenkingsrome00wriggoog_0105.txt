11. Pomoerium.] This was a narrow belt of land running
round the city, on either side the city wall. It was held sacred,
and was therefore left unoccupied. No building might profane
it on the inside, no plough on the outside.

13. Animadversum] Animadverte (from animum adverto)
means ‘turn my mind to,' ‘considtr,' ‘notice ;’ and specially,

in the text: animadvertam in filium, ‘I will punish my son.’
But when it meanssimply ‘observe,’ ‘notice’ ‘consider,' it is
followed, as a transitive verb, hya noun in the accusative: as
nutrz'x animadvertit puerum dormientemcircumplicatum serpentis

14 Fuisse] Notice this compound of the future participle
and the past tense of sum, arrswen'ng to· our compound of
‘would’ or ‘should have' with the past participle: as, nari te
astarem, mariturusfui: ‘If Ι had not seen you, I should have
died ;¹ the compound in Latin literally meaning, ‘I was just on
the point of dying ;’ but implyingrthat as 1 saw you, 1 did not
die: just as the English compound' means, ‘I was bound or
under obligation to die 3’ but implies, that I did not die. ln
aratio obliqua this construction becomes as usual, dicit se, naz
te aedisset, moriturumsmhsq as in the text: except that in the
text the imperfect essct denotes a state still existing, not an
action already completed, as vidisset. -
