on indirectly by my exercising control over myself. We see
from its origin why tempero is followed by the dative, when it
means ‘spare’ But pareo, the ordinary Latin word for ‘spare,’
is also followed by the dative. Hence it appears that the
Romans regarded sparing asan action which did not pass on
ditectly to the object spared. And naturally; for if we spare
a person, we rather do not do, than do, anything to him. See
XIX. 17, and note down pareo and tempere, ‘spara’

b. As, then, temero, in the sense of ‘spare‚' is intransitive, it
cannot pass through the persons of the passive voice. We can
say, in English, Iam spared; but we cannot say in Latin, tem·
perer, parrer, any more than we can say, curror, ‘I am run ;’
ambula, ‘Iam walked.' It is only an object acted on directly
that can be named as the subject of a passive sentence. We
must, therefore, have recourse to the impersonal construction,
and say, as in the text, temperdtum est tempbh ‘mercy was
shown to the temples ;’ templis being in the dative after tem-
peratum, exactly as it would be after temperavere. So, for ‘we

sgh‘mjj spyalrlelour enemies,' the Latin is, parcendum est inirerieis.

5. Ab armis] Notice this double use of ab. Quies ab ornei's,
‘ rest from arms3 ’ dabutur ab rege, ‘was given by the kIngs But
there is no real difference. Ab is put before the noun naming
the agent, because the action is conceived as coming from the
agent. ‘No rest-giving came from the king.'

6. Implicitus] Literally‚ ‘was entangled in a tedious
disease.’ The earlier writers preferred implicavi, inplicatam
the later, implicari, implicitus.

7. Degeret.] The subject-word to degeretis the omitted an·
recedent to qui. Ratur esset is in the subjunctive, because the
relative clause, of which it is the verb, is inserted in the sub·

joined clause, eet—degeret. For degeret, see VII. 3.
Dego (from de and ago) is properly a transitive verb, meaning

‘spend,’ ‘pass ;’ some word meaningtIme, as dreni, tempus, being
‘commonly used alter it. But this word is not unfrequently
omitted, like exercitum, after duco (XIX. 6); and dege by itself
means ‘pass ti1ne‚' ‘live :’ as in the text. So, letus deget, ‘he

will live happy' (Hor. Od. XXIX. 42.)
